/**
 * Deadline for a single backend read before it is abandoned and treated as a
 * miss.
 *
 * Sized from prod telemetry (`cache.read_ms` on `EdgeCacheService.getOrCompute`,
 * 7 days), which is sharply bimodal rather than long-tailed:
 *
 *   <10ms   3170 reads     40-80ms      6 reads
 *   10-20ms  623 reads     80-150ms    12 reads
 *   20-40ms   65 reads     150-249ms    8 reads
 *   >=249ms 1255 reads (1145 of them abandoned at the deadline)
 *
 * A read that is going to succeed has done so by ~20ms; the 40-249ms band holds
 * 26 reads out of ~5,100 (0.5%). Reads past that are hung, not slow, so the old
 * 250ms deadline bought almost no extra hits and charged the full 250ms to every
 * hung read — 22% of all reads. 40ms sits above the real read distribution and
 * below the hang floor.
 *
 * The gap is empty because of how Cloudflare meters connections, not because
 * the cache is bimodally slow: `cache.match()` counts against the Worker's
 * six-simultaneous-connection limit while it waits for response headers, and a
 * seventh call is queued until one of the six gets its headers. So a read
 * either finds a free slot and returns in ~10ms, or it queues behind whatever
 * holds the slots — usually warehouse `fetch()` calls, which take 110ms to
 * several seconds to return headers. There is no middle. Measured: reads issued
 * while a warehouse query is in flight time out 29.9% of the time vs 16.6%
 * otherwise, and the rate climbs with the number of cache reads in the request
 * (1 read 8.4%, 4 reads 35.9%).
 *
 * Lowering this deadline therefore costs almost no hits: a queued read was
 * never going to arrive at 45ms. It does NOT fix the queueing itself.
 * https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/
 *
 * The deadline's premise is that abandoning a read is cheap. That holds only
 * when `compute` was going to open a connection anyway — and it is false in the
 * worst case, because `Promise.race` cannot cancel the loser and a Workers
 * `cache.match()` is not cancellable at all. An abandoned read keeps its
 * connection slot until it finally resolves, so `compute` opens a *seventh*
 * connection and queues behind the read we just gave up on. Measured over 7
 * days: reads that completed cost a span p50 of 26ms on the org-config bucket,
 * reads abandoned at this deadline cost 2547ms — same compute, 98x apart.
 *
 * Two mitigations follow from that, both below: `readTimeoutMs` lets a caller
 * whose `compute` is expensive wait longer, and `READ_BREAKER_*` stops issuing
 * reads on a bucket that is timing out, since each one is a slot the rest of
 * the request cannot use.

 * connection slots until it resolves, which is what makes the sibling reads
 * time out in the first place. Skipping is therefore self-correcting — fewer
 * reads in flight, fewer slots held, and the next read after the window has a
 * free slot to land in.
 *
 * This was a count of *consecutive* timeouts that any single success reset to
 * zero. That is memoryless at exactly the rates seen in production — measured
 * over 24h on `caches.default`: 61 timeouts against 45 hits and 236 misses, so
 * roughly one read in five, arriving interleaved rather than in runs. The
 * breaker opened, waited its window, let one read through, saw it succeed,
 * reset to zero, and paid two more full deadlines before opening again. It
 * never converged, and timeouts still cost a span p50 of 12,936ms.
 *
 * An exponentially-weighted ratio keeps the history a run-counter throws away.
 * Recovery is still fast but no longer free: from a saturated ratio of 1.0 a
