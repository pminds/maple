# Maple Docker Agent

A single-container OpenTelemetry Collector for plain Docker hosts — the non-Kubernetes sibling of
[`deploy/k8s-infra`](../k8s-infra/README.md). It ships in the same image
(`ghcr.io/mapletechlabs/maple/otel-collector-maple`); this directory holds the ready-to-run config that
gets baked into that image at `/etc/otel/docker-config.yaml`, selected via
`--config /etc/otel/docker-config.yaml`.

What it collects:

- **Per-container metrics** via the `docker_stats` receiver (CPU, memory, network, block I/O,
  restarts, uptime, PIDs) every 30 seconds, over a read-only mount of the Docker socket
- **Container logs** via `filelog` over the `json-file` driver directory (optional mount)
- **App OTLP** on 4317 (gRPC) / 4318 (HTTP), so it doubles as the host's local collector

All signals export over OTLP HTTP to Maple's ingest gateway, which owns ingest-key auth and org
enrichment — same contract as the k8s chart. The end-user install guide (one-liner + compose
variant, what lights up in the product) lives at
[`apps/landing/src/content/docs/guides/docker-infrastructure.md`](../../apps/landing/src/content/docs/guides/docker-infrastructure.md);
the engineering end-to-end (attributes → queries → UI, and the design decisions) at
[`docs/docker-container-monitoring.md`](../../docs/docker-container-monitoring.md).

## What the install one-liner assumes

The one-liner itself and its Compose equivalent live in the docs guide linked above, kept in one
place so the image tag can't drift between copies. This README owns the contract behind it.

| Variable            | Required | Meaning                                                        |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MAPLE_INGEST_KEY`  | yes      | Org's private ingest key (`x-maple-ingest-key` header)         |
| `MAPLE_ENDPOINT`    | no       | Ingest gateway override for self-hosted (default hosted)       |
| `MAPLE_ENVIRONMENT` | no       | `deployment.environment(.name)` for unlabeled data (`production`) |

Notes that are easy to get wrong:

- `--user 0:0` is required: the runtime image is distroless **nonroot**, and neither the Docker
  socket nor `/var/lib/docker/containers` is readable by that user.
- The log-directory mount only feeds log collection — drop it to skip container logs. The
  `maple-agent-state` volume persists filelog checkpoints across restarts.
- The environment stamp uses `insert`, not `upsert`: app OTLP passing through the agent keeps its
  own `deployment.environment.*`; only unlabeled data (docker_stats, filelog) gets the agent's.
- Compose labels (`com.docker.compose.project`/`service`) become `compose.project` /
  `compose.service` — the Docker analog of the k8s namespace/workload facets. The receiver sets
  them as datapoint attributes; `transform/compose` promotes them to resource, which is where the
  container queries read them. Drop that processor and the project/service facets go empty.

## Config and image lifecycle

- [`collector-config.yaml`](./collector-config.yaml) is baked into the image by
  [`deploy/k8s-infra/Dockerfile.otel-collector-maple`](../k8s-infra/Dockerfile.otel-collector-maple);
  editing it requires a new image release to take effect for users of the one-liner.
- The image is built from [`deploy/k8s-infra/builder-config.yaml`](../k8s-infra/builder-config.yaml)
  (OpenTelemetry Collector Builder manifest — `dockerstatsreceiver` joined in 0.2.0) and published
  by `.github/workflows/publish-otel-collector-maple.yml` on `otel-collector-maple-v*` tags.
- Every user-facing reference to the tag (this README, the install modal in `apps/web`, the docs
  guide) must point at a tag that is already on GHCR — push the release tag before shipping copy
  that names it. The BYO-ClickHouse `renderCollectorYaml()` stays on the latest published tag for
  the same reason.

Not supported yet: rootless Docker (socket lives at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/docker.sock`), podman, and
non-`json-file` logging drivers (metrics still work; logs need the json-file directory).
