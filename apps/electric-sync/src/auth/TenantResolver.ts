/**
 * Tenant resolution behind a service boundary.
 *
 * `makeResolveTenant` is pure config → function, so this wrapper adds no logic —
 * what it adds is a seam. Built inline in the route, it made every authenticated
 * path untestable: a test cannot mint a Clerk session, so nothing past the 401
 * could be reached, and the proxy's actual job (that *this* org's id is the one
 * pinned into the upstream WHERE) went unasserted. As a service it can be replaced
 * with a fixed tenant, which is what the router tests do.
 *
 * Clerk and self-hosted are both covered by `makeResolveTenant`; there is no
 * API-key path here, because this worker has no database and the browser's
 * shape-fetch only ever sends the session bearer.
 *
 * No membership verifier is passed, and that is deliberate: this worker has no
 * membership directory, so `x-maple-org-id` is REJECTED here rather than
 * ignored. A silently ignored selection would serve the token's own rows under
 * another organization's name.
