// 650 KB from #225 until 2026-09-05. The Releases page (#764) costs ~1.5 KB of
// startup — 0.9 of it the domain contract every page's API client carries,
// the rest two route registrations and the atoms — after its route shell,
// loader and adapter had already been trimmed to nothing. main had meanwhile
// moved to 649.4 KB on its own, so the honest number is this one, not a
// contract with fields the page needs deleted from it.
// 653 KB from #776 (2026-09-07): the AI model detect contract is 0.3 KB of
// the same kind — a `MapleInternalApi` group every page's client carries —
// and main had reached 651.7 KB by then. The 33 vendor marks it added cost
// nothing: the icons chunk hash did not move, they are tree-shaken until a
// surface renders them.
// 682 KB from #783 (2026-09-07): the vendor marks stopped being free. The 33
// added with the detect contract cost nothing while nothing rendered them;
// the Agent Sessions list, header, rail and waterfall now do, and the mark
// table retains all forty in the `icons` chunk startup already loads. Measured
// against one base, the marks are +27.6 KB (651.5 → 679.1) and the rest of
// this page is ~0.3; main had reached 652.7 by then, so the honest number is
// the 680.3 this branch builds. Splitting the marks out was tried and does not
// work: `@/components/icons` re-exports them, so the barrel's own chunk keeps
// a static edge to them however they are reached. Dropping the marks from the
// model lanes is what buys the 27 KB back, not a lazy import.
// 684 KB from #800-#802 (2026-09-08): the Agent Sessions detail work — the
// leaner header, the model marks on the filters and the agent-time breakdown —
// lands in the route registry and the startup index chunk, not in a new
// dependency. main measures 683.8 with all three in, so this is the honest
// number rather than a target the pages would have to be cut back to.
// 685 KB from #806 (2026-09-08): the onboarding rebuild costs ~0.6 KB of
// startup — the setup checklist's hints for eight surfaces instead of four,
// the role/intent id literals and legacy-save maps in the quick-start atom the
// root gate reads, and one lab registry entry. The cards' own copy is split
// off so the route chunk carries it. main was at 683.4 KB.
