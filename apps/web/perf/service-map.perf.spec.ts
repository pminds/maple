	// vsync-capped at ~60 and pan rendering is software-bound at ~14 fps
	// regardless of code quality (below even the pre-fix SVG baseline), so the
	// strict pan numbers are physically unreachable there. Under CI we keep the
	// discriminating idle gate (post-fix ~60 fps / p95 ~17ms vs the pre-fix
	// SVG-filter cost of ~23 fps / p95 ~50ms) plus a "pan isn't frozen" floor.

	// consecutive attempts while fps drifted 44.7 -> 43.6 -> 41.7 and red-failed a
	// 45 floor on a branch that touches no web code. fps is frames divided by
	// wall-clock, so it counts time the CI host descheduled the browser entirely;
	// p50/p95 measure how the frames that DID run were paced. 16.7ms is exactly
	// vsync and 33.4ms is exactly one dropped frame — the rendering was perfect on
	// the run that "failed".
	//
	// Pacing still separates the regression this test exists to catch: the pre-fix
	// per-edge blur + SMIL cost ~23 fps, i.e. p50 around 43ms. fps keeps a
	// not-frozen floor only, exactly as pan already does below.
	//
	// The CI bounds were re-baselined when the map started framing itself
	// correctly. They previously read 25/40, measured against a map that — after
	// ELK landed — was left at zoom 1 in a corner of a 6946x3123 graph, so idle
	// timed a nearly empty viewport at a flattering 16.7/16.7. With the camera
	// pinned (above) and the graph actually drawn, the same runner measures
	// 33.3/50 with React fully idle: 0 commits, 0ms blocking, 0 long tasks, three
	// consecutive attempts, identical to the decimal. That is the runner's
	// software rasterizer pacing at two vsyncs per frame, not code doing work —
	// there is no work left to do.
	//
	// So p50 is the discriminating bound and sits at 40, between the 33.3 measured
	// here and the ~43 a returning SVG-filter regression would cost. p95 is only a
	// not-pathological bound; on a GPU-less host it cannot separate implementation
