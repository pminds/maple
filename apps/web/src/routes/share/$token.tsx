/**
 * A shared dashboard, or a single shared chart.
 *
 * Renders outside the app shell entirely — no sidebar, no breadcrumbs, no
 * command palette, no chat sheet. `DashboardLayout` is the authed chrome and
 * assumes a signed-in org throughout, so this page composes its own.
 *
 * `?embed` drops even this page's own header, for a public chart dropped into
 * someone else's document. The server decides whether a link may be framed at
 * all (`embeddable`); this flag only controls how much chrome is drawn.
 *
 * Those are two separate checks and both are needed. `?embed` is chosen by
 * whoever wrote the URL, so it cannot gate anything; `embeddable` comes off the
 * resolve response and is gated below, in `FrameGate`. The worker serves this
 * route without `frame-ancestors` precisely so embedding is possible at all —
 * which makes the page the only layer that knows which token it is holding, and
 * therefore the only one that can enforce the server's answer.
