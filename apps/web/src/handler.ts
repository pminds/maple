/**
 * Frame and referrer policy, applied to document responses.
 *
 * The app is a single-page bundle, so every route is the same index.html and
 * there is no per-route server render to hang a header on — the path is all
 * this layer knows. That is enough for the split that matters:
 *
 *   - Everything except `/share/` refuses framing outright. The authed app has
 *     no reason to be in anyone's iframe, and until now nothing said so.
 *   - `/share/` allows framing at the document level, because embedding a
 *     public chart is a feature. *Which* links may be framed is decided by the
 *     API (`embeddable` on the resolve response) and enforced by the page, which
 *     is the only layer that knows which token it is holding.
 *
 * `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` is share-specific and load-bearing rather than
 * hygienic: the token is in the share URL, so without it every cross-origin
 * request the page makes hands the token to a third party in `Referer`. The API
 * deliberately keeps tokens out of its own URLs; this is the other half.
