/**
 * Coalesces individual query executions into `/internal/query-engine/execute-batch`.
 *
 * This is now the only way a query reaches the warehouse from the browser — the
 * single-query `/execute` endpoint was removed once this batcher had carried all
 * traffic for a full release.
 *
 * Every warehouse module funnels through one choke point, and each atom runs on
 * its own fiber, so a render pass used to emit one POST per query — each with
 * its own CORS preflight, against a worker pinned to us-east-1. A dashboard
 * could open dozens of round trips before painting anything.
 *
 * A *timer* window (not `queueMicrotask`) is what makes this work: atoms mount
 * across separate React commits, and a microtask can't span a commit boundary,
 * so most calls would still go out alone.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `Effect.request`/`RequestResolver` — those batch within a
 * single fiber's execution graph, and these callers are on unrelated fibers.
