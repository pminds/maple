// device get the local SVG marks the replays list already uses. Everything else
// gets nothing — a made-up icon is worse than no icon.
//
// About the favicon service (`favicon.maple.dev/?url=<host>`): it answers 200
// for *every* host, serving its own letter-monogram SVG when it can't find a
// real icon. So a client-side monogram fallback would be dead code, and `onError`
// only ever fires on a genuine network or service failure. That case renders an
// empty box of the same size rather than nothing, so a row whose icon fails does
// not shift its label out of line with the rows around it.
