 * exception, and the reason this chart exists — "how many people" against "how
 * much they read" is the comparison the page is opened for, and neither number
 * means much without the other.
 *
 * That pair is deliberately **not stacked**, and the visitors area paints over
 * the page-view area rather than under it. The two come from different tables
 * with different coverage, so reading visitors as a subset of page views is the
 * correct reading; reading their sum as anything is not.
 *
 * Buckets are outer-joined on the union of both series' timestamps, so a window
 * where one table has data and the other doesn't shows a gap in one line rather
 * than shifting the other sideways. Within that union a count with no row is
 * drawn as zero — only a series that reports nothing at all in the window stays
 * a gap.
