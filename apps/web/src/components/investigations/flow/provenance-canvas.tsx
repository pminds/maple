/**
 * The overview's lead: the whole causal chain on one canvas.

 * investigation, what it dispatched, what it concluded and what it proposes are
 * one left-to-right read now, and the page stops repeating itself.
 *
 * xyflow with hand-computed positions rather than a layout engine: the graph is a
 * fixed column grid (`provenance-graph.ts` owns the arithmetic), and ELK would
 * buy nothing but a worker round-trip before first paint. What xyflow *is* here
 * for is pan, zoom and fit — a seven-action report is wider than any column this
 * page has.
