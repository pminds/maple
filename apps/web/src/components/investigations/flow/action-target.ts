 * The API returns prose, not structured actions, so both are inferred from the
 * verb. The two are deliberately separate answers: an action can have a
 * recognisable kind and still have nowhere in Maple to perform it — "roll back
 * deploy 8f21c" is unmistakably a rollback, and there is no deploys page to send
 * anyone to. Classifying and routing together would have meant that row losing
 * its icon as well as its link.
 *
 * Routing stays conservative — the wrong link is worse than none, so an
 * unrecognised verb gets `target: null` and the node renders no call to action
 * rather than a dead one.
