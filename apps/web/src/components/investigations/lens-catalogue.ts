 * Display copy for a lane, and the seed catalogue's static fallback.

 * This file used to be the only place the web knew what a lens was called,
 * because the catalogue was fixed and a copy edit shouldn't need an API deploy.
 * Hypotheses are planner-written now, so the *name* is data: no static table can
 * say "the 14:02 payments-api rollout". The server sends `lens_name` and
 * `lens_question` and they win.
 *
 * What stays here is the fallback, and it earns its place twice — for lanes
 * written before the planner (whose `lensId` still names a catalogue entry) and
 * for the seed hypotheses a run falls back to when the planner produces nothing
 * usable.
