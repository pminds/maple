/**
 * Local message/part types for the chat UI, materialized from Maple's own durable
 * chat transport (`@maple/domain/chat-session`) by `useMapleChat`. A message is a
 * role plus an ordered list of parts; a part is either prose or one tool call's
 * full lifecycle (`input-available` → `output-available`/`output-error`).
 *
 * This used to be Flue's `FlueConversationMessage`/`FlueConversationPart` (hence
 * `UIMessage`/`UIMessagePart` — the alias outlived the type it was aliasing). Kept
 * as the name here because every component in this directory already calls it
 * that, and `ChatStatus`/`FileUIPart`/`SourceDocumentUIPart` are declared locally
 * so the UI doesn't pull in the (removed) Vercel AI SDK.
