// A straight alias of the schema type, as of v3.

// This used to be `Omit<..., "endpoint"> & { endpoint: DataSourceEndpoint }`,
// which bundled two unrelated jobs: keeping `serverFunctionMap` statically total,
// and rejecting a typo'd endpoint at the widget-definition call site. Neither
// survives contact with a discriminated union — `Omit` over a union collapses to
// the keys every arm shares, so the result was a type that demanded `endpoint`
// from arms that do not have one.
//
// Both jobs now live where they belong: `DataSourceEndpoint` below is its own
// union and still keys the registry exhaustively, and the typo check moved to
// `makeRouteDataSource`'s type parameter in `@maple/widgets/dashboard`.
//
// Still deliberately NOT `DeepMutable`, unlike the display/layout aliases below.
// A data source is replaced wholesale — the builder never edits one field of it
// in place — and keeping it readonly is what lets the constructors in
// `@maple/widgets/dashboard` be assigned here directly, instead of every call
// site fighting a variance mismatch. `DeepMutable` over a union would also strip
// the readonly modifiers that make the arms discriminate cleanly.
