// BOUNDARY: This module owns unparsed external values and narrows them before domain use.
// The replay engine seam
//
// The player used to construct `new Replayer(...)` inline, which made rrweb the
// only thing it could ever play. The iOS SDK records H.264 segments and wraps
// each one in rrweb-*shaped* events so the chunk pipeline carries them
// untouched — but there is no DOM to rebuild, so rrweb renders nothing.
//
// Everything above this interface (the provider's transport state, the trimmed
// timeline, markers, idle bands, the chunk loader) is format-agnostic and stays
// exactly as it was. Everything rrweb-specific lives in `rrweb-engine.ts`;
// everything video-specific in `video-engine.ts`.
//
// The contract is deliberately shaped like the rrweb surface the provider
// already depended on, so the refactor is behaviour-preserving:
//
//   new Replayer(events, {root})   -> ReplayEngineFactory.create({mount, events})
//   getMetaData().totalTime        -> totalTimeMs
//   getCurrentTime()               -> getCurrentTimeMs()
//   play(o) / pause(o?)            -> play(o) / pause(o?)
//   setConfig({speed})             -> setSpeed(speed)
//   addEvent(e)                    -> addEvent(e)
//   destroy()                      -> destroy()
//   on(Finish) / on(Resize)        -> onFinish / onResize callbacks
//   .iframe + .wrapper.style       -> fit(container)
