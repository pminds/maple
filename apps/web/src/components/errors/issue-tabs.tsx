/**
 * The page's three questions, split.
 *
 * The body was seven sections in one `space-y-8` stack, each titled with the
 * same 10px eyebrow — so the sample traces, which is where you go the moment you
 * have read the message, sat below the activity log, the incidents table and the
 * anomalies list. Splitting them puts each one tab-click from the header instead
 * of a scroll away, and lets the Overview stop competing with itself.
 *
 * `<Link>`s rather than the `Tabs` primitive, for the reasons
 * `investigations/investigation-tabs.tsx` gives: the strip is pinned in `Sticky`
 * while the panel scrolls in `Scroll`, so one `Tabs` root would straddle two
 * layout regions; the active tab belongs in the URL; and links give middle-click
 * and history for free.
