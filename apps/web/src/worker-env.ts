 * The Worker's runtime environment, as this app is allowed to see it.

 * Structural on purpose, like the `HTMLRewriter` slice in `og/share-preview.ts`:
 * this app's tsconfig is a browser one (`lib: DOM`), and importing
 * `@cloudflare/workers-types` to describe two bindings would retype the entire
 * SPA. The bindings are declared thirty lines above where they are read, in
 * `worker.ts`, which is what keeps the two in step.
 *
 * Everything except `ASSETS` is optional because absence is a real runtime
 * state, not a type error: this worker only exists on deployed stages (`bun
 * dev` serves the SPA through Vite, not through this worker), and a dev-stage
 * deploy without an api domain binds neither key.
