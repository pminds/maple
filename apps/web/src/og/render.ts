/**
 * Rasterising the preview card, in the Worker.
 *
 * takumi is a Rust layout+raster engine compiled to wasm. The module is a
 * static import rather than bytes fetched at runtime because workerd refuses to
 * compile wasm it was not given as a module — `WebAssembly.compile` on fetched
 * bytes is dynamic code generation, which the runtime blocks.
 * `@takumi-rs/wasm/auto` resolves to the `workerd` export condition, which is
 * exactly that module.
 *
 * Fonts have no such restriction, so Geist is read from the deployed assets
 * (`public/og/*.ttf`, produced by `scripts/build-og-fonts.ts`) instead of being
 * bundled. Without them the card renders in takumi's built-in grotesque, which
 * is legible and is not Maple — the whole card is typography, so the typeface
 * is the design. **TrueType, not woff2**: the loader takes a woff2 buffer
 * without complaining and then ignores it.
 *
 * The renderer, the wasm instance and the fonts are module-scoped. An isolate
 * serves many requests, and re-instantiating a 3.7 MB module per image would
 * cost more than the drawing does.
