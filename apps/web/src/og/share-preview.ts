/**
 * Social previews for share links, served by the SPA's own Worker.
 *
 * Two halves of one feature:
 *
 *   - `shareOgMetaRewriter` inlines a link's real `og:*` tags into the shell.
 *     Crawlers do not run JavaScript, so a client-rendered head is invisible to
 *     every chat client that unfurls a link — the tags have to be in the HTML
 *     the Worker returns, and this is the only server in that path.
 *   - `renderShareOgImage` answers the image those tags point at.
 *
 * Neither half decides anything. The API owns every judgement — whether a link
 * is public, whether it is still live, what its board is called — and this
 * module renders what it is handed. That is also why the token never reaches
 * the image URL: the meta response carries a signed, opaque image id instead,
 * and the image endpoint hands that back to the API to resolve.
 *
 * Failure is always "leave the page alone". An unfurl that falls back to the
 * generic Maple card is a worse preview; a rewrite that throws is a broken
 * dashboard, and the page is what people actually came for.
