/**
 * The alert chart image, served by the SPA's own Worker.
 *
 * Same shape as `renderShareOgImage`, and for the same reasons: the API owns
 * every judgement (does this id verify, what series may it read), and this
 * module only draws what it is handed. It exists on the web origin rather than
 * the API's because that is where the takumi wasm and the Geist fonts already
 * are — one renderer, two images.
 *
 * The fetchers of this URL are Slack's and Discord's servers and whatever mail
 * client opens the email. None of them holds a Maple credential, which is why
 * the endpoint behind it is unauthenticated and the id is signed instead.
