 * addressable by the new org: the UI re-rendered the previous org's rows until
 * the idle TTL expired — up to 30 minutes on some atoms. Electric collections
 * never had this bug because their ids already embed the org.
 *
 * The org is prefixed rather than folded into the encoded object because atoms
 * decode the key back into the query input; an extra field there would travel
 * to the server as part of the request payload.
 *
 * NUL cannot occur in `encodeKey` output (it is JSON) or in a Clerk org id, so

 * minutes at a time, but the boundary still has to be crossed eventually, and

 * and only an identity that ignores time can find what was there before.
