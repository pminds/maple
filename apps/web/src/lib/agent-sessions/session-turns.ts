// exactly why they live here, named and commented, instead of inside the
// components that render them.
//
// Timestamps are parsed as reported, without the clock-skew correction
// `span-tree.ts` applies inside a single trace, so a child that a skewed clock
// placed outside its parent can land in a neighbouring turn.

 *    conversation id still opens each turn by invoking the agent.
 * 3. One turn per trace — the floor. Wrong for a trace holding several turns,
 *    but it never merges two traces into one turn, and it always renders.
 *
 * Assignment then depends on which rule fired. On rule 1 the id a span CARRIES
 * decides, because concurrent turns make time meaningless as an owner: a pure
 * time cursor gives each lane only the sliver before the next lane anchored and
 * dumps every lane's tail into whichever anchored last. On rules 2 and 3 — and
 * for any span carrying no id — a turn owns every span that started before the
 * next turn did, whatever trace or service it came from. Spans that start before
 * the first anchor (a gateway span that opens the trace, say) join turn 1 rather
