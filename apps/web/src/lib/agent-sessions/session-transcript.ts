// The session read as a conversation: turns, threads, messages, tool calls.
//
// `SessionTurn.spans` is a TIME SLICE — every span that started inside the
// turn, whatever trace or agent it belonged to. Rendering it in that order
// interleaves concurrent branches into nonsense ("planner said X", "db-lane
// said Y", "planner said Z"), so this module re-derives structure from
// parentage instead and keeps each agent's thread contiguous, marking the
// places where two threads genuinely overlapped in time.
//
// Everything the transcript claims is read from a span. Nothing is inferred:
// a tool call with no captured result says the result is missing rather than
// implying success, a call with no captured message falls back to its
// structure, and a truncated session ends on a divider rather than on what
// happens to be the last row.
//
// The output is a FLAT row list, the same shape the waterfall virtualizes:
// nesting lives in `depth` and in explicit open/close rows, because a tree of
// components cannot be windowed and a thousand-block session has to stay
// scrollable.
