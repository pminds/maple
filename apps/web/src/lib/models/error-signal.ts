// One fingerprint, all of what we know about it.
//
// `/errors` and `/errors/issues` were two renderings of the same object: the
// warehouse groups error events by `FingerprintHash`, and `error_issues` is
// keyed on that same hash (ErrorsService's per-minute tick upserts one issue
// per fingerprint it observes, so the issue table is the complete set, not a
// triaged subset of it). Neither view alone answered the triage question —
// the warehouse knew the volume and shape, Postgres knew the severity, state
// and owner, and the investigation lived on a third route.
//
// An `ErrorSignal` is those three joined on the fingerprint hash.
