/**
 * Keep the last success on screen while a *differently keyed* atom loads.
 *
 * Effect-atom already covers a refresh of a live atom — that yields a waiting
 * result carrying the previous value. It has nothing to offer when the atom
 * itself changes, which is what every filter rail does: ticking a checkbox
 * rewrites the search params, the components build a new atom key, and the
 * fresh atom starts at `Initial`. Every `Result.builder(...).onInitial(...)`
 * on the page then paints its skeleton, so a one-checkbox filter reads as a
 * full page reload.
 *
 * `withRetention` (see `retained-atom.ts`) closes the same gap at the atom
 * layer, but only across *time windows* — its identity deliberately keeps the
 * filters, because a persisted cache that served one filter's rows under
 * another's key would be wrong for every later reader.
 *
 * This is the render-local half: the previous value is held by the hook call
 * itself, so it can only ever be shown to the component that just watched it
 * arrive. It is returned flagged `waiting`, which is the signal list pages
 * already dim on — data stays put, the page marks itself busy, and the rows
 * swap when the query lands.
 *
 * The org is part of the retained entry rather than assumed stable: an org
 * switch also rebuilds every atom key, and showing the previous org's rows —
 * even dimmed, even briefly — is the exact leak `ORG_KEY_SEPARATOR` exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * The tradeoff is deliberate: a detail page whose key comes from a route param
 * shows the previous entity's numbers for the length of one query. That is the
 * same call the service-detail panels already made one at a time; it is worth
 * it because the alternative — every list, chart and facet count in the app
 * unmounting into a skeleton on a checkbox — is what this removes. Surfaces
 * that must not show a stale value read `result.waiting` and say so.
