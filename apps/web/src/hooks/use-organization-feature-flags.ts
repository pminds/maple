 *
 * **Fail closed while loading.** Clerk has not answered yet, so no flagged
 * surface renders. Callers that draw a conclusion from "off" must gate on
 * `isLoaded` (see its doc comment).
 *
 * **Fail open when self-hosted.** There is no Clerk to read metadata from, and
 * treating that as "all flags off" would hide flagged features from self-hosters
 * permanently — a rollout flag is a tool for staging the managed product.
 *
 * **Never call a Clerk hook outside Clerk mode.** `apps/web/src/main.tsx` mounts
 * `ClerkProvider` only when `isClerkAuthEnabled`, and Clerk v5 hooks throw
 * without one. An `if (!isClerkAuthEnabled) return …` *inside* a hook is too late
 * — `useOrganization()` has already run and thrown. So the implementation is
 * chosen here at module scope, off a build-time constant: each variant calls its
 * hooks unconditionally, hook order is fixed for the lifetime of the bundle, and
 * the self-hosted build never reaches the Clerk one. This is the hook-level form
 * of the boundary `org-switcher.tsx` and `select-plan.tsx` draw at the component
 * level.
