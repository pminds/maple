/**
 * The investigation detail page's data, live.
 *
 * This replaced `MapleApiV2AtomClient.query("investigations", "retrieve")` plus a
 * 3s `useIntervalRefresh`. Two Electric shapes — the investigation row and its
 * lens lanes — are recombined into the same `V2Investigation` the page already
 * rendered, so every consumer below it is unchanged; what changed is that a lane
 * reaching `checking`, a progress note, or the verdict landing now arrives when
 * it happens rather than on the next tick.
