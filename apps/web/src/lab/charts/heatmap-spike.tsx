 * 0.14.0 cannot express it. This is worth recording rather than silently
 * omitting, since the API reads as though it can.
 *
 * The pieces all appear to be there: `motion()` from `@tanstack/charts/motion`,
 * a chart-level `motion.delay` callback over `ChartMotionContext` (which
 * carries `datum`, so a column index is a `Map` lookup away), and
 * `addEnterMotionTrack` in `dist/motion.js` ending in a generic
 * `opacity: 0 → target` track that is not gated on mark role. It was wired up
 * exactly that way and measured. What actually happens:
 *
 * - The renderer mounts. `RendererChart` + `motion()` produce a
 *   `.ts-chart-surface` root, so the plumbing is live, not misconfigured.
 * - `initial: true` is additionally wrong under SSR: `animate = !reduced &&
 *   (initial ? motion.initial && (!adoptedRoot || motion.initial === "always")
 *   : …)`, and this app server-renders, so an adopted root skips the entry
 *   animation. `"always"` is the documented fix.
 * - With `"always"` set, reduced-motion off, and the sweep stretched to a
 *   NINE-SECOND window, no `cell` rect ever received an `opacity` attribute and
 *   `data-ts-motion-role` was never set on anything. No enter track is created
 *   for `cell` at all. The only role with bespoke entrance choreography is
 *   `"bar"` (`dist/motion.js`, gated on `timingContext.role === "bar"`).
 *
 * `states[].transition` is dropped for the same reason: state easing is applied
 * BY the motion renderer, so with no animating renderer mounted it is
 * configuration that cannot take effect. Hover feedback is therefore instant
 * here, where production eases it over 100ms in CSS — the one place this chart
 * still feels less finished than the thing it replaces.
 *
 * Re-test when the package leaves pre-alpha; if `cell` gains an enter track the
 * wave is a dozen lines (`delay: (ctx) => columnIndex.get(ctx.datum.x) * 12`).

/**
 * Phase 0 spike: can `cell` over two band scales plus a sequential colour scale
 * replace `query-builder-heatmap-chart.tsx` (925 lines of hand-rolled CSS grid,
 * two-pass layout solver, own colour interpolation, own log normalize/invert, own
 * tick selection, and arithmetic hit-testing)?
 *
 * Answer: the *rendering* half, yes, and at a fraction of the code. Four things
 * are worth knowing before anyone ports the production chart.
 *
 * 1. **`cell` has no `fill` channel.** `RectOptions.fill` is `fill?: string` — a
 *    single flat colour, not a `VisualChannel`. Per-cell colour has exactly one
 *    route: the `color` channel plus a chart-level colour scale. That makes the
 *    colour-scale question (see `color-scale.ts`) load-bearing rather than
 *    optional, which is not true of `hexagon`, whose `fill` *is* a channel.
 * 2. **Holes come free, and only because both band domains are pinned.** A `{x,y}`
 *    pair with no row emits no cell, so whatever is painted underneath shows
 *    through — the required distinction from a minimum-value cell. But band
 *    domains are otherwise inferred from the observed channel values, so an
 *    entirely empty column or row would silently vanish from the axis instead of
 *    rendering as a gap. The pinned `scaleBand(domain, range)` instances below
 *    are what makes a hole a hole.
 * 3. **`colorGradientLegend` works** — it needs `colors.domain` to be numeric
 *    `[min, max]` and calls `colors.map(value)` per step, both of which the
 *    hand-rolled scale satisfies. One honest caveat: it walks the domain
 *    *linearly* and samples the ramp at each value, so under `scaleType="log"` the
 *    bar shows the log-warped ramp against a linear value axis. That is correct
 *    (each swatch really is that value's colour) but it is not the production
 *    legend, which instead labels evenly-spaced *swatches* with their inverted
 *    values via `valueAtT`. There is no hook to supply tick positions.
 * 4. **Scale factory vs instance.** `scaleBand` (the factory) infers; `scaleBand()`
 *    (an instance) keeps its empty configured domain and renders nothing at all.
 *    Instances are passed here *because* the domain is being pinned deliberately.
 *
 * ## The hover cascade, and the undocumented selector that makes it possible
 *
 * `ChartMarkStateSelector.focus` accepts `'primary' | 'group' | 'key' | 'x' |
 * 'y' | 'series'` **and `'unmatched'`** (`types.d.ts:94`, resolved at
 * `mark-state.js:104`). `'unmatched'` appears nowhere in the package docs and is
 * the one that matters: it resolves to `!matches("group")`, i.e. every cell that
 * is not the focused one. Combined with `'x'` / `'y'` — which compare `xValue` /
 * `yValue` against the focused point (`focus-layer.js:233`) — a heatmap gets a
 * real crosshair with no DOM overlay and no geometry arithmetic, which was the
 * single largest parity gap `FINDINGS.md` recorded against production.
 *
 * States apply in ARRAY ORDER and their transitions merge (`resolveNodeState`,
 * `mark-state.js:63`), so the cascade below reads literally: dim the field, then
 * restore the cross, then mark the cell.

		//
		// - `rect` with `x1: firstCategory, x2: lastCategory`. A band scale's
		//   `map()` returns the band CENTRE, so the rect spans centre-to-centre —
		//   measured at `x: 206.64, w: 867.46` against a plot starting at `x:
		//   71.74`. It renders as a visible slab offset into the grid. `inset`
		//   cannot correct it either: the missing bleed is half a band on each
		//   axis (135px vs 76px here) and `inset` is one number for all four sides.
