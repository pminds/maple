# TanStack Charts pilot — findings

**Date:** 2026-08-17 · **Version tested:** `@tanstack/charts` / `@tanstack/react-charts` /
`@tanstack/charts-scales` **0.14.0** · **Baseline:** Recharts 3.10.1

Supersedes the 2026-08-05 spike, which ported the same three charts to 0.6.4 and was reverted.

## Migration log (2026-08-18)

Four query-builder charts are now on TanStack: **line**, **histogram**, **area**, **bar**.
The 80% they share was extracted first into `packages/ui/src/components/plot/timeseries.tsx`
(`useTimeseriesModel`, `timeseriesXAxis`, `timeseriesYAxis`, `timeseriesTooltipBody`,
`timeseriesLegend`), which took the line chart from 375 to 166 lines and is what the area and
bar ports compose rather than transcribe.

**The perf gate had been failing silently since `f81b028674`.** That commit promoted
`tanstack-chart.tsx` into `PlotFrame` and deleted the `<div data-bench-chart>` wrapper that both
`tanstack.perf.spec.ts` and this bench's own `isReady` check selected on, so every TanStack arm
matched zero elements and three tests failed. The selectors now use `PlotFrame`'s real
attributes: `[data-chart-plot]` for the plot rect (the true analogue of
`.recharts-cartesian-grid` — the region inside the axes, not the whole card) and
`[data-chart-host]` for counting charts. Re-measured after the repair, the §1 numbers hold
exactly: recharts 243.8ms / 504 commits, tanstack-svg 68.3ms / 146, tanstack-canvas 67.4ms / 146.

Corrections to what is written below:

- **Bug 2 (grouped focus) is no longer a blocker, and both escape routes turned out to be
  viable.** Wide-row charts (line, area) read the row off `points[0].datum` through
  `createTooltipFocusStore`; the bar port took the "idiomatic fix" the section says a real
  migration would be forced into — long-form cells and one `barY` with a `z` channel — because
  `barY` resolves stacking AND side-by-side grouping within one mark off `z`, so one-mark-per-
  series would overlay every series with no offset. It was a local change, not the data-layer
  restructure this section predicted.
- **The `errorRate` bug in §"Unrelated production bug found in passing" is already fixed.**
  `throughput-area-chart.tsx` now computes `throughput * errorRate` with no `/ 100`, and carries
  a comment saying `errorRate` is a fraction. That section is history, not an open defect.
- **`areaY`'s baseline stroke is still present at 0.14.0.** `dist/area.js` emits
  `[...top, ...reversed bottom]` and both renderers close the path, so a stroke traces the whole
  polygon. Worked around as recommended: fill-only `areaY` with `stroke: "none"` plus a `lineY`
  over the top edge. `areaY` also has no `strokeDasharray` at all, which is why the in-flight
  tail is a second pair of marks.
- **`whenFocused` does not size focus nodes to zero.** At 0.14.0 it emits full-radius circles
  into a `visibility="hidden"` `.ts-chart__focus-layer` group, which is what a test must select
  on.
- **`barY` does not need a band scale.** It falls back to `inferBandwidth(scale, xValues, width,
count)`, which takes the minimum gap between distinct plotted x positions and keeps 80% of it —
  functionally Recharts' `barCategoryGap="15%"`, so passing an `inset` on top would subtract the
  gap twice. This is what lets bar share the continuous `scaleTime` axis with line and area
  instead of regressing to the categorical band axis the line port deliberately left behind.

Known drift from the Recharts baseline, not fixable at 0.14.0: `minPointSize` has no equivalent
(tiny non-zero bars render invisible), and `barY`'s `radius` is one scalar on all four corners
rather than Recharts' top-two-of-the-topmost-segment.

### Second wave: pie and heatmap ported, funnel and hbar deliberately not

**Pie** is `polar` → `radialArc` ×2 + `radialText`, with `pie()` as the eager angle transform.
The technique that unlocked in-slice labels: `radialText` needs an angle AND a radius scale, so
pin the angle scale to `[0, 2π]` — making it the identity over the radians `pie()` already
computed — and range the radius scale from the donut hole to the outer edge
(`range: [innerRadiusFor, ctx => ctx.radius]`). "How far across the ring" then means the same
number on a pie and on a donut of any hole size. Returning `null` from the `radius` channel skips
both the label node and its focus point, which is how a sub-6% wedge opts out without leaving an
invisible hover target. `radialArc` declares `requiresAngleScale: false` /
`requiresRadiusScale: false`, so adding those scales for the label mark costs the arcs nothing.
Lost at 0.14.0: the drop shadow (no mark exposes a filter) and the label's paint-order stroke
(`RadialTextOptions` has `fill` but no `stroke`).

**Heatmap** is two `cell` marks over two pinned `scaleBand` instances. The two-pass layout solver,
`pickXTicks` and the y-tick stride loop are gone — a band scale positions the cells and the axis
thins tick labels by MEASURED collision with ends prioritised on a categorical x (`thinTickLabels`,
`scene.js:986`), which is what the stride approximated. `CellGrid`, the crosshair overlay divs and
the manual hit-testing are replaced by the `states[].when.focus` cascade. What survived is a band-
padding solver: `paddingInner` is solved so the seam lands on 2px and the surplus is bought back as
`paddingOuter` + `align(0.5)`, so cells cap at 72×40 and the grid centres rather than stretching.
Lost: hovered axis-label emphasis (`tickLabels.fontWeight` resolves at scene build, so driving it
from focus means rebuilding the definition per cell crossing), eased hover (motion renderer is
SVG-only and creates no track for `cell`), and `title` attributes on truncated labels. One
deliberate change: the colour domain is now `[min, max]` over the DRAWN cells, so pruned all-zero
tracks no longer drag `min` to 0 and stretch the ramp over data the chart doesn't paint.

**Funnel and hbar were not ported, on purpose.** Neither was ever a Recharts chart — both are flex
columns of DOM rows with percentage-width fills. Canvas buys nothing at ~10 rows and would cost the
things DOM gives free: CSS `truncate` with ellipsis on arbitrary category names, the `title`
attribute that recovers the truncated name, text selection, and the height-driven "+N more" cap
that keeps rows inside the card. `barX` does exist at 0.14.0; using it would mean re-implementing
per-row text truncation and right-aligned `tabular-nums` columns as canvas text layout, which is
strictly worse output for strictly more code.

### `PlotFrame` gained `usePlotScales()` and an `overlay` slot (2026-08-18)

`ChartScene.scales` was always reaching `PlotFrame`'s `onRender`; it is now published through a
store beside the plot rect, as the replacement for Recharts' `useXAxisScale()`. The store dedupes
on scale descriptors plus `viewport` plus the plot bounds rather than object identity, because the
scene hands back a fresh `scales` record — with fresh `Date` domains and fresh `map` closures — on
every pointer tick; publishing by identity would put a render on the hover hot path.
`plotScalesInterchangeable` is exported and tested for exactly that reason.

The `overlay` slot renders pointer-transparent DOM over the plot box, replacing the old pattern of
passing a node as a Recharts CHILD so it could reach `usePlotArea` / `useXAxisScale` /
`ZIndexLayer`. Note `decorative()` (undocumented, in `dist/mark-decorative.js`) is the right tool
for annotations that must extend a scale — it keeps a mark's scale contribution and painted
geometry while `stripMarkSceneInteraction` removes its focus points — but NOT for the commit
markers, which are pre-snapped to existing buckets and so extend nothing.

### Third wave: the fixed-metric service charts, and the end of the sync bus (2026-08-18)

Latency, throughput, apdex and error rate are ported, which is the whole `MetricsGrid` — `/` and
the service detail page.

**`useTimeseriesModel` does not fit them, and forcing it would have been wrong.** That hook is
built around series DISCOVERED from the data: it treats every column that is not `bucket`/`partial`
as a series, remaps each to a synthetic `s1..sN` key, and hashes an identity colour out of the raw
column name. A service-detail row carries `hasSampling`, `errorRate`, `tracedThroughput` and three
percentiles at once, so discovery would plot the booleans and the operands of derived series; and
`p50`/`p95`/`p99` have designated tokens that mean the same thing product-wide, which a hash would
break. What DID generalise is everything downstream of the series list, and that is
`plot/fixed-metrics.tsx` — bucket parsing that KEEPS every column, the axis context, the chrome
colours, the tooltip focus store, and the suppression flag. The axis builders in `timeseries.tsx`
are shared verbatim on top of it, with one new option: `timeseriesYAxis({ format })`, because
`formatLatency` is not `formatValueByUnit(v, "duration_ms")` and a throughput tick carries a rate
suffix derived from the bucket size.

**`syncId` is gone from the chart layer entirely** — the prop, the `RechartsSyncProps` mixin (now
`PlotOverlayProps`), `MetricsGrid`'s two-mode switch, and the call sites. It had been dead in
production since `syncMode` defaulted to `"cursor"`.

**`yAxisWidth` survived, and the measurement is why.** The hypothesis was that the ported charts
would line up on their own. They do not: measured across the service grid, the four plots start at
64.5 / 58.1 / 38.3 / 51.6 px from the card edge, because each solves its own margin from its own
tick labels ("155.0ms" against "0.9"). The linked cursor genuinely does not care — it works in
per-plot ratios, and the sub-pixel alignment assertion passes either way — but the commit markers
do: `layoutMarkerLabels` decides whether two deploys merge into one chip from the plot WIDTH, so a
26px spread groups the same commits differently on adjacent cards. Reimplemented as a LEFT MARGIN
LOCK (`ChartSpecBase.margin`, `resolveMarginLocks` in `scene.js`) rather than Recharts'
`<YAxis width>`; `service-detail.perf.spec.ts` now asserts the four plot rects share one left edge.

**The linked cursor's capture-phase throttle stays.** `PLOT_SELECTOR` widened to
`[data-chart-plot], .recharts-cartesian-grid` (mirroring `perf/plot-locator.ts`), but the 30Hz
`onMouseMoveCapture` throttle was NOT removed. It is unreachable for a TanStack chart — the
renderer binds native `pointermove` on its own container (`dist/renderer.js:574`,
`dist/interaction-cursor.js:183`), a sibling of the React tree, and a synthetic `mousemove` stopped
in React's capture phase never reaches a native listener on a descendant — but the infra grids
(host metrics, k8s workloads, the correlation panel) are still Recharts and still linked, and for
them it is load-bearing.

**The bench's `recharts` arm is retired.** It rendered the PRODUCTION overview charts as the
baseline, so once those became TanStack the arm was its own opposition and matched zero
`.recharts-wrapper` elements. `/lab/bench/tanstack` now A/Bs canvas against SVG, which is still a
standing choice, and `tanstack.perf.spec.ts` gates that instead. The pilot's verdict below is the
record of the Recharts comparison; it is not re-measured.

`/lab/bench/service-detail` lost its `?mode=` arm for the same reason, and its perf spec's
recharts-vs-cursor ratio became an absolute commit ceiling: the hovered chart's tooltip body reads
the focus store through `useSyncExternalStore`, so a 180-step sweep commits ~180 times (one chart's
worth), against the ~1117 a four-chart sync storm produced. The storm baseline lives on in
`infra.perf.spec.ts`.

Reproduce: `bun run --cwd apps/web test:perf:tanstack`
Look: `/lab/bench/tanstack?renderer=tanstack-svg|tanstack-canvas`

## 1. Perf

Three arms, identical rows (145 buckets × 3 charts), one 180-step trusted-input pointer sweep
across the first chart. Two consecutive local runs:

| renderer        | React render (ms) | React commits | blocking (ms) | dropped frames |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| recharts        | 243.6 / 243.6     | 504           | 0             | 0              |
| tanstack-svg    | 94.0 / 77.8       | 146           | 0             | 0              |
| tanstack-canvas | **75.0 / 74.4**   | **146**       | 0             | 0              |

**TanStack Canvas does ~3.3× less React render work and ~3.5× fewer commits than Recharts.**
Commit counts were byte-identical across runs — the gap is structural, not noise: Recharts
drives tooltip state through React on every pointer tick, TanStack updates an imperative scene
and commits only the tooltip body.

Two honest caveats:

- **`totalBlockingMs` is 0 on all three arms on this machine**, so that assertion currently has
  no teeth locally. The discriminating gate is React render work. Blocking time only bites on a
  slower runner (CI).
- This **contradicts the 2026-08-05 result only in appearance.** That spike measured _DOM
  mutations per hover move_ (Recharts 3.7, TanStack 41) and explicitly never measured CPU. Both
  are true: TanStack touches more DOM nodes and spends far less CPU. CPU is what users feel, and
  this is the first valid measurement of it.

## 2. The seven 0.6.4 bugs, re-checked at 0.14.0

| #   | 0.6.4 bug                                                                          | Status at 0.14.0                                                                                                      |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | `spec.gradients` dropped by the DOM renderer; `fill: url(#id)` resolved to nothing | **FIXED** — gradients render in both SVG and Canvas, no `<defs>` injection needed                                     |
| 2   | `focus: "group-x"` returns one mark's point, not the group                         | **STILL OPEN** — see below                                                                                            |
| 3   | `whenFocused(dot(...))` renders a dot per datum                                    | **STILL OPEN** — 435 nodes to show 3, but SVG-only; see below                                                         |
| 4   | `areaY` strokes the whole outline incl. baseline                                   | **BY DESIGN** — fill-only `areaY` + `lineY` on top is the documented composition; see below                           |
| 5   | No time scale in `charts-scales`                                                   | **BY DESIGN — we had it wrong.** Compact scales stop at linear/band/point/ordinal; d3-scale is the documented upgrade |
| 6   | `<Chart>` needs explicit `width`/`height`                                          | **NOT A BUG — we had it wrong.** Omit `width`; it follows the container. See below                                    |
| 7   | `.ts-chart-tooltip` inline styles with no opt-out                                  | **FIXED** — every inline style is now a `var(--ts-chart-tooltip-*, fallback)`; see below                              |

### Bug 2 is the significant one

`focus: "group-x"` — and the exported `focusGroupX` strategy object, which behaves identically —
returns `points.length === 1` with `group: null`, even with three marks sharing an x scale. So a
grouped tooltip cannot be built from `points`.

The cause is architectural, not a small defect: **TanStack groups by the `z` channel _within_ one
mark**, over long-format data. Recharts' one-`<Area dataKey>`-per-series idiom has no group to
find. Two ways out:

- **What this pilot does:** read the row off `points[0].datum` and render the series from it.
  Preserves mark-for-mark parity with Recharts, so the perf comparison stays fair.
- **The idiomatic fix:** `fold()` to long format and use a single mark with `z`. Cleaner and
  probably faster, but it gives up per-series styling — the dashed error-throughput overlay and
  the p50/p95/p99 stroke variants each need their own mark today.

A real migration would have to pick the second and restructure the data layer. That is a bigger
change than "swap the chart component".

### Tooltip theming (bug 7) is now a solved problem

The shell still writes its own inline styles, but every one is
`var(--ts-chart-tooltip-*, fallback)` — background, color, border, radius, padding, shadow, font,
max-width. Setting those custom properties in a plain class rule wins with **no `!important`**,
which the 0.6.4 notes said was required. `backdrop-filter` and `transition` aren't written inline
at all, so they're set directly.

`tooltip.css` maps them 1:1 onto `chartTooltipCardClassName`
(`packages/ui/src/components/ui/chart.tsx:234`) and the result is pixel-comparable to a Recharts
tooltip: `bg-popover/90`, `border-border/50`, `rounded-xl` (12px), `px-3 py-2`, `shadow-xl`,
`backdrop-blur-md`. The body markup mirrors `ChartTooltipContent`'s rows — swatch, muted label,
right-aligned `font-mono tabular-nums` value.

**Anchor to the pointer, not the datum.** This is the one that matters for feel. The default
`anchor: "point"` pins the card to each bucket's plotted position, and with `placement: "auto"`
it re-picks a side as it goes — measured, a 60px pointer move shifted the card 97px, and it
flipped from the left of the cursor to the right mid-sweep. `ChartFloatingTooltip` anchors at the
cursor with a fixed `side="right"` / `sideOffset={12}` for exactly this reason. Matching it
(`anchor: "pointer"`, `placement: "right"`, `offset: 12`) makes tracking exactly 1:1 — a 96px
cursor move moves the card 96px, always 12px off the pointer.

**No position transition — and "it measured free" was the wrong test.** `ChartFloatingTooltip` can
transition its position because it moves by transform, which the compositor interpolates
independently of the pointer. This shell positions with `left`/`top`, so the same transition makes
the card visibly trail the cursor: it reads as lag. It also cost nothing measurable (canvas 71.3ms
inside a 64–80ms band, commits pinned at 146), which is exactly the trap — the cost was never CPU.
Only opacity is animated, via `@starting-style`, and all of it is disabled under
`prefers-reduced-motion`.

### Focus visuals, and the clearest argument for canvas (bug 3)

The hover affordances match Recharts: a dashed vertical cursor (`crosshair()`, styled from
`--border` — note its default `strokeOpacity` is 0.35, invisible over Maple's dark palette, so it
is forced to 1), a dot on each series at the hovered bucket (`whenFocused(dot(...))`), and the
nearest series' tooltip row bolded.

Two things fell out of building it:

- **Focus grouping works for painting but not for reading.** The dot layer resolves focus _per
  mark_ — all three latency series get a dot — while the tooltip's `points` still carries exactly
  one (bug 2). The same focus state produces a group for one consumer and not the other.
- **Bug 3 is still open, and it is the sharpest illustration of the canvas case.** `whenFocused`
  emits a circle for every datum and sizes the unfocused ones to zero rather than skipping them:
  measured at **435 nodes (145 buckets × 3 series) to display 3**. The canvas arm paints the
  identical result with no DOM at all. Adding the crosshair and both dot layers moved canvas not
  at all (75.2ms / 146 commits, versus 64–80 / 146 before). `tanstack.perf.spec.ts` pins the 435
  count so an upstream fix gets noticed.

## The chart gallery (`/lab/charts`, `test:perf:charts`)

Ten TanStack charts (seven when the table below was measured), eight of them beside the production
implementation they'd replace. All render with zero page errors. Ring sweep for the pies, horizontal sweep for the rest, 180 steps.

| chart                       | React ms | commits | verdict                                        |

21 arms, 41.2s, **zero dropped frames and zero long tasks on every one**. Re-measured after the
2026-08-18 rendering fixes below, which changed the box-plot fixture and the trace-scatter domain,
and after the earlier sizing fix — the production charts previously rendered clipped, so the first
table this file carried was not a fair comparison.

**The timeseries arms are the second real consolidation case, after the histogram.** All three
production timeseries charts sit at 374–410 commits, the same per-pointer-tick React tooltip
pattern the histogram shows; the TanStack arms land at 24–64. Note the split within those 61–64:
that is roughly **one commit per bucket crossed** (60 buckets), which is the floor for a tooltip
that changes content — Recharts spends ~7 commits per bucket for the same information. The stacked
bar's 24 is lower still because 24 buckets is all there is to cross.

**Turning the dashed tail on costs nothing.** `line-incomplete` (36.7ms / 61) against `line`
(39.8 / 61) and `area-incomplete` (48.5 / 64) against `area` (38.8 / 64) — identical commit counts,
render time inside run-to-run noise. Three extra marks over a six-row slice do not register.

**The histogram is the strongest consolidation case among the three original pairs, not the pie.** 382 commits vs 11 is the same
structural gap as the overview charts: Recharts drives its tooltip through React on every pointer
tick. The pie's 18-vs-9 is slice-transition-driven in both arms and means nothing.

Two measurement traps this shook out, both now handled in the spec:

- The production heatmap draws **no `<svg>` or `<canvas>`** — it's a CSS grid of divs. Locating on
  `svg, canvas` hangs until the test times out.
- Its grid occupies the top-left of a 320px card, so sweeping the _card's_ centre line crosses
  empty space and records **0 commits** — which reads as "fastest chart in the table" and actually
  means "never responded". The `commits > 0` assertion exists to catch exactly this.

## The heatmap polish pass (2026-08-18)

`heatmap-spike.tsx` was taken from "renders the right rectangles" to something with a real hover
model, borrowing from `Subhan-code/Amicro--Micro-transitions-`. Four package facts came out of it,
two of them useful and two of them limits.

### `states[].when.focus` accepts `'unmatched'`, and it is undocumented

`ChartMarkStateSelector.focus` is typed `ChartFocusMatch | 'unmatched'` where `ChartFocusMatch =
'primary' | 'group' | 'key' | 'x' | 'y' | 'series'` (`types.d.ts:94`). The docs cover the named
matches; **`'unmatched'` appears nowhere in them**. It resolves to `!context.matches("group")`
(`mark-state.js:104`) — every point that is not the focused one.

That single selector, plus `'x'` and `'y'` (which compare `xValue`/`yValue` against the focused
point, `focus-layer.js:233`), is a heatmap crosshair with no DOM overlay and no hit-test
arithmetic. States apply in array order and merge, so the cascade is literally:

```ts
states: [
	{ when: { focus: "unmatched" }, style: { opacity: 0.28 } }, // field recedes
	{ when: { focus: "x" }, style: { opacity: 1 } }, // column returns
	{ when: { focus: "y" }, style: { opacity: 1 } }, // row returns
	{ when: { focus: "primary" }, style: { stroke, strokeWidth: 1.5, inset: 0, radius: radius + 1 } },
]
```

This closes the largest parity gap against production, and arguably beats it: production paints two
additive 10%-foreground bands and dims nothing, which reads worse on a grid where every cell already
carries colour. Subtraction is the stronger affordance here.

Note `ChartRectStateStyle` is `Pick<…, 'fill' | 'fillOpacity' | 'stroke' | 'strokeWidth' | 'opacity'
| 'radius' | 'inset'>` — **no `strokeOpacity`**, which the previous hover ring was setting. It was
inert.

### The motion renderer mounts and animates nothing (for `cell`)

`motion()` from `@tanstack/charts/motion` was wired up to port the reference's column-wave entry
(cells fading in per column, 12ms apart). It does not work at 0.14.0, and the failure is silent —
the chart simply appears fully painted, exactly as if motion had never been configured.

What was established, in order:

1. **`motion()` is a renderer, not a wrapper.** `dist/motion.js:42` declares `id: "svg-motion"` and
   mounts an `svg.ts-chart` root, throwing otherwise. It is **SVG-only**; there is no canvas
   equivalent, so an animated chart could never look the same in both arms.
2. **It really does mount.** With `RendererChart` + `motion()` the DOM gains a `.ts-chart-surface`
   root (`dist/react/RendererChart.js`), so the plumbing was live.
3. **`initial: true` is wrong under SSR** — a genuine trap worth keeping. The gate is
   `animate = !reduced && (initial ? motion.initial && (!adoptedRoot || motion.initial === "always")
: …)`. This app server-renders, the renderer ADOPTS that markup, and an adopted root therefore
   skips the entry animation entirely. `"always"` is the documented opt-in.
4. **Even with `"always"`, reduced-motion off, and the sweep stretched to a nine-second window, no
   `cell` rect ever received an `opacity` attribute and `data-ts-motion-role` was never set.** No
   enter track is created for `cell` at all. `dist/motion.js` has a generic
   `opacity: 0 → target` enter track, but the only role with real entrance choreography is `"bar"`
   (gated on `timingContext.role === "bar"`).

`states[].transition` went out with it: state easing is applied _by_ the motion renderer, so with no
animating renderer mounted it is configuration that cannot take effect. **Hover feedback in this
chart is instant**, where production eases it over 100ms in CSS. That is the one place the port
still feels less finished than the thing it replaces, and it is not fixable from our side today.

Retest when the pre-alpha label drops. If `cell` gains an enter track the wave is a dozen lines:
`delay: (ctx) => columnIndex.get(ctx.datum.x) * 12`.

### Two ways a full-plot background rect does not work

The reference's nicest structural idea is a **two-layer cell** — a neutral track under the coloured
inner — which is also how production draws grout (`--heatmap-grout`) so a hole reads as a hole _in a
surface_. Neither route to a single panel behind the plot works:

- `rect` with `x1: firstCategory, x2: lastCategory`. A band scale's `map()` returns the band
  **centre**, so the rect spans centre-to-centre — measured at `x: 206.64, w: 867.46` against a plot
  starting at `x: 71.74`. It paints as a slab offset into the grid, visible through any dimmed cell.
  `inset` cannot rescue it: the missing bleed is half a band per axis (135px vs 76px on that fixture)
  and `inset` is one number for all four sides.
- `rect` with the extent channels omitted, hoping it fills the plot. It emits no node at all
  (rect count 45 → 44).

So grout is per-slot instead: a holes-only `cell` mark under the data. The seams keep showing card
background. What that buys beyond looks is the important half — **a hole becomes a focusable point**,
so hovering an empty slot says "no data" instead of `focus: "nearest"` snapping to a neighbour and
confidently reporting someone else's count.

### A pruned domain does not prune the data

Dropping an all-zero column from the band domain while leaving its rows in the mark does not hide
them. The scale maps the orphaned category to nothing and the mark emits `<rect x="null">`, which
the browser resolves to `x=0` — stacking the pruned column on top of the first visible one, so the
column renders split down the middle by a second, wrongly coloured cell. Domain and data have to be
filtered together (`model.visibleRows`), and the colour domain has to be computed from the survivors
or the pruned zeros drag `min` to 0.

### The perf number above is stale

The recorded 2.6ms / 5 commits predates this pass, and the states cascade is real per-hover work:
every cell now resolves up to four state selectors per focus change instead of one. **Re-run
`?arm=heatmap-tanstack` before quoting it.** It was not re-measured here because the automated
browser pane suspends rendering while hidden, and `endInteraction()` awaits frames that never
arrive — the sweep never completes. It needs a human-visible browser.

### Parity gaps in the ports (visible in the gallery)

- **Pie**: slice order and colours differ. Production uses `resolveSeriesColors(name)` — stable per
  series name; the spike indexes `--chart-1..5` positionally.
- ~~**Heatmap**: y-axis order is inverted~~ — **fixed**. The spike now reverses `yDomain`, so
  `300ms+` sits at the top as production does. Band `y` maps `domain[0]` to the top, so
  first-appearance order ran the wrong way.
- **Line / area / stacked bar**: colours differ, and the cause is upstream of the port. The
  query-builder charts rename every series to `s1..sN` before colouring, so they always get the
  generic palette; the spikes use the semantic tokens the real chart would (`--chart-p50/p95/p99`,
  `--chart-throughput/error`). Geometry is identical — compare shapes, not hues.

### `clip` is off by default, and marks with extent paint outside the plot

`ChartSpecBase.clip` defaults to **false**, so marks are not bounded to the plot rect. A hexagon is
drawn around its bin _centre_, so `hexbin` bins on the left edge painted half a hex over the y-axis
tick labels. `clip: true` fixes it.

Two follow-ons worth knowing:

- Clipping alone leaves a clipped edge mark sitting ~3px **into** the labels, because the plot rect
  butts straight against them. Tick `padding` is what buys the gap (measured: −3px overlap → +3px
  gap at `padding: 10`).
- This only affects marks whose shape extends around a point. Audited all seven: `hexbin` was the
  only one. `rect`/`cell` are bounded by their band or interval, `boxY`'s glyphs sit inside their
  category, and sankey/treemap are laid out in final pixels. So `clip` is worth setting on
  point-extent marks specifically, not blanket-enabling.

### Two gallery-harness bugs that looked like chart defects

Both were mine, and both initially got written up here as production problems. Recorded because
either would mislead the next person reading a side-by-side.

1. **Charts bled across cards.** `ChartContainer` deliberately sets
   `[&_.recharts-surface]:overflow-visible` so axis labels can escape the SVG box; production
   clamps that one level up at `CardContent`'s `overflow-hidden` (`widget-shell.tsx:213`). The
   gallery card had no clamp, so recharts labels landed on the next chart. **This is not a
   production defect** — I reported it as one.
2. **The production histogram appeared to have no x axis.** `ChartContainer` also sets
   `aspect-video`, and `MetricsGrid` cancels it with `className="h-full w-full aspect-auto"`
   (`metrics-grid.tsx:127`). Without that class the chart sizes itself 16:9 — taller than a 320px
   card — and the axis is pushed out and clipped. The gallery now passes the same class, and the
   labels render fully inside the card, evenly spaced and **not** colliding. An earlier note here
   claiming they collide was wrong.

The `split("-")[0]` bug in `query-builder-histogram-chart.tsx:122` is unaffected by either — it is
a code-level fact (a negative lower bound yields `""`, and the `||` fallback then prints the whole
unsplit range), confirmed by reading rather than by rendering.

### Polar / pie spike (2026-08-17, `/lab/charts`)

`polar` + `pie` + `radialArc` **works**: a donut paints under both renderers, at exactly **one
`<path>` per slice** (5 rows → 5 paths, no per-datum overdraw), with theme tokens resolved to
`oklch` literals. Tooltip reads `42.9%` against the production chart's `43%`.

Four things that will bite anyone building a polar chart:

1. **`focus: "nearest"` silently does nothing on polar marks** — no tooltip, no focus state, no
   error. `focusGroupAngle` (from `@tanstack/charts/polar`) is the polar strategy and works.
2. **The default tooltip body prints raw polar coordinates** — `x 1.336 / y 113.76`, i.e. the angle
   in radians and the radius in pixels. Every polar chart needs its own `renderTooltipBody`.
3. ~~**No hover affordance is possible, and there is no workaround.**~~ **CORRECTED 2026-08-18 —
   this was wrong, and instructively so.** Everything it observed still holds: no polar mark has
   `states`, hovering changes zero arc attributes, and `whenFocused(mark: ChartMark)` genuinely
   cannot wrap a `PolarMark` (`polar({ marks })` requires one, and `InitializedPolarMark` carries
   `colorValues`/`angleValues`/`radiusValues` that `InitializedMark` lacks). The error was the
   conclusion drawn from it — "cannot be reproduced by any route" — reached by only ever looking
   _inside_ the chart definition.

    The route is above it. **`onFocusChange` on the Chart component** reports the focused datum to
    React, and a **second `radialArc` over just that slice** gives it its own radius and opacity.
    Per-mark options stop being a limitation once the mark list is a function of hover state. The
    production pie's fade + 1.035 scale is now reproduced exactly — measured on the SVG arm, the
    hovered wedge's bbox goes 144×272 → 149×281 (1.035) while the other four drop to
    `fill-opacity="0.55"`.

    The cost is a rebuilt definition per slice crossing, which is affordable only because
    `onFocusChange` is **edge-triggered** — it fires when the focused datum changes, not on every
    pointer move. That distinction is the whole reason this is viable rather than a per-tick React
    storm, and it is worth remembering for any other mark family that lacks `states`.

    General lesson for the rest of this document: "the mark cannot express X" and "the chart cannot
    do X" are different claims, and this file conflated them once already.

4. **Row types must not have an index signature.** `pie()` returns
   `Omit<TDatum, PieDerivedField> & …`, and `Omit` over a type with an index signature resolves
   `keyof` to `string | number` and drops every named field — `slice.name` comes back `unknown`.
   Separately, string field-name channels (`startAngle: "startAngle"`) fail to typecheck for the
   same reason, so accessors are mandatory. Normalize to a closed row type at the boundary
   (`toBreakdownRows` already does this).

### Bug 3 is cardinality-dependent, which the earlier note missed

`whenFocused`'s cost is a node **per datum**, so it scales with the data, not the chart. 435 nodes
for a 145-bucket × 3-series timeseries is bad; the same mechanism on a 5-slice pie would be 5. The
distinction matters when deciding where the SVG renderer is still acceptable.

### Two new gotchas not in the 0.6.4 notes

- **Scale factory vs instance.** `scale: scalePoint()` (an instance) silently keeps its empty
  configured domain and the chart renders axes with no marks. `scale: scalePoint` (the factory)
  infers from the data. Pass an instance _only_ to pin a domain — `scaleLinear().domain([0, max])`.
- **No zero anchor.** Recharts' `YAxis` anchors a numeric domain at 0; TanStack's inferred linear
  domain starts at the data minimum, which clipped the p50 line. Needs an explicit configured domain.

### Timeseries arms: line, area, stacked bar, and the dashed partial tail (2026-08-17)

Added to `/lab/charts` as five pairs plus one solo arm, over
`apps/web/src/lab/charts/timeseries-data.ts`. Two findings, one in each direction.

**1. The `_incomplete` twin-column trick is a Recharts workaround, not a requirement.**

`markIncompleteSegments` (`packages/ui/src/lib/incomplete-buckets.ts`) rewrites every row into
`key` / `key_incomplete` column pairs and duplicates one value into both to bridge the join. It has
to: a `<Line dataKey>` is a **string**, so one series can carry exactly one dash style, and a
solid-then-dashed line is therefore two series.

TanStack channels are accessors, so the same picture is **two marks over two slices of the same
array** — `rows.slice(0, first)` and `rows.slice(first - 1)`, where the shared row at `first - 1`
_is_ the bridge point. No row is copied, no column is invented, and the row type stays closed.
`splitAtFirstPartial` is nine lines against that function's ninety-seven. `lineY.strokeDasharray`
being a plain `string` is what makes it work; `areaY` has none at all (bug 4's neighbour), so a
dashed area edge is still a faded fill plus a dashed `lineY` — the same composition the Recharts
arm uses, for the same reason.

**2. `barY.strokeDasharray` is a per-datum `VisualChannel` — the one place TanStack is strictly
more capable.** A partial bucket's bars dash inline, no twin series and no second stack id.
Compare `query-builder-area-chart.tsx:421-443`, which needs its own `stackId: "b"` to reproduce
the stack geometry for its dashed twin, and `query-builder-bar-chart.tsx`, which never calls
`useIncompleteSegments` at all — **Recharts bars have no partial-bucket rendering in Maple today**.
That is why `stacked-bar-incomplete-tanstack` has no production counterpart to pair against.

Also: `barY` stacks through the `z` channel over **long-form** rows (one row per bucket per
series), where Recharts needs a `<Bar dataKey>` per service over wide rows. Adding a series becomes
a data change instead of a JSX change.

**Fixture note — the partial fixtures are anchored to wall-clock `now`, deliberately.**
`QueryBuilderLineChart` rebuilds its rows as `{bucket, s1..sN}` before calling
`useIncompleteSegments`, so a `partial` flag set upstream never reaches `markIncompleteSegments`
(and passing it through would register `partial` as an extra series). The production arm can only
infer partiality from the spacing + wall-clock heuristic, and a fixed 2026 timestamp exercises
nothing. `timeseries-data.ts` evaluates that same predicate against one captured `NOW_MS`, so both
arms classify the same buckets and the dashed tail starts at the same one. The plain arms keep the
fixed past anchor and stay fully deterministic.

**Bug 3 is unchanged, and an earlier revision of this section said otherwise.** It claimed
`whenFocused` had regressed to painting every dot at full radius, on the evidence that all 180
emitted circles carry `r="3.5"`. The radius is real; the conclusion was not. The dots are hidden by
`visibility: hidden` on their group, not by a zero radius, so nothing is painted at rest and the
lines are not beaded — what looked like beading in a screenshot was a 1214→800px downscale. The
original finding stands as written: the waste is DOM nodes, not pixels.

**Measured.** `test:perf:charts` now covers 21 arms (41.2s); the numbers are in the table above.
The headline: the three production timeseries charts are 195–228ms / 374–410 commits against
20–40ms / 24–64, and switching the dashed tail on is free.

### Six rendering defects found by looking at the gallery (2026-08-18)

Every one of these was invisible in the perf numbers and obvious on screen. Four are library
constraints worth carrying into a migration decision; two were ours.

**1. `lineY` forces round line caps, and it silently eats dash gaps.** `dist/line.js:123-124` sets
`lineCap: "round"` / `lineJoin: "round"` on every node, and `LineYOptions` exposes no `lineCap`. A
round cap adds `strokeWidth / 2` of ink to BOTH ends of every dash, so Recharts' `"4 4"` — crisp
there, because `<Line>` leaves the default butt cap — paints `4 + w` on against a `4 - w` gap here.
At a 2.5px stroke that is 6.5px of ink and a 1.5px gap: the incomplete tail rendered as a wobbly
solid line. `roundCapDasharray(on, off, strokeWidth)` in `chart-shared.tsx` takes the cap out of the
dash and gives it to the gap. **Anyone porting a dashed Recharts series must do this conversion or
the dash disappears.**

**2. `radius` on a stacked `barY` cannot round only the outer corners.** It is a flat `number`
handed to one rect node per SEGMENT (`dist/bar.js:142`), and the renderer's `beginRoundedRect`
(`dist/canvas.js:637`) applies it to all four. So a stack is either rounded at every interior seam
or square throughout — there is no per-corner or per-stack-position form. Recharts' `<Bar radius>`
takes `[tl, tr, br, bl]`, so this is a genuine capability loss. The spike is square.

**3. `boxY`'s `inset` is not the width knob it appears to be.** It forwards to the internal `barY`'s
inset, which the renderer clamps: raising it from 10 to 26 moved the drawn box by about two pixels
(measured, 92.29px wide either way). `paddingInner` on a **pinned** band scale is what actually
sizes a box — 0.55 took it to 65.73px. The cost is that the domain must then be supplied by hand.

**4. `clip: true` is not enough for point-extent marks; the domain has to be padded.** The earlier
note here says `clip` fixed `hexbin` painting over the axis labels. It stopped the overpaint, but
the edge bins are still CENTRED on the plot edge, so the chart ended in a column of half-hexagons
that were visibly truncated and yet still hit-tested and still opened a tooltip — the shape lied
about the bin and the target no longer matched the paint. Padding the x domain (~1.6% of span,
roughly one bin) moves those centres inward. `clip` goes back to being a backstop.

**5. A chart is a figure, not prose.** Neither renderer sets `user-select`, so dragging across a
chart — which is what hovering a timeseries looks like — started a text selection and painted the
browser's selection highlight over the whole `<svg>`/`<canvas>`. `select-none` on
`TanstackChartFrame`. Recharts never showed this because `ChartContainer`'s content is unselectable
by construction.

**6. `"currentColor"` is not a portable fill.** The heatmap's hover ring used it: it resolves by
inheritance on SVG and resolves to nothing on canvas, so the affordance silently differed between
the two arms. Every colour in a chart spec has to be a resolved literal — which is the entire reason
`usePlotColors` exists, and the rule was already written down two sections above. (The same state
also dropped `inset` to 0 on hover, growing the cell by a pixel a side, so the ring arrived with a
size jump that read as the grid twitching.)

Ours, not the library's: the box plot's fixture. It summed sine terms for the spread and then
multiplied every 17th sample by ~2.6 to manufacture outliers, which gave every operation a narrow,
near-symmetric IQR while pushing the axis maximum to ~4× the tallest box — every box collapsed to a
few pixels and the chart read as a bar chart. Replaced with a seeded lognormal (the generator
`trace-scatter-spike.tsx` already had), which produces its own outliers past 1.5×IQR, plus a **log
y axis**: latency across operations spans orders of magnitude, and on a zero-anchored linear axis
the fast operations' boxes sit on the baseline while the slow one's outliers set the scale. The
shared `createLogScale` in `lab/charts/log-scale.ts` is that scale — `charts-scales` still ships no
log scale, so this lab now has one implementation instead of the two copies it had grown.

### Legends: the package ships three, and most of these charts can use none of them (2026-08-18)

Every `QueryBuilder*Chart` on the production side of the gallery renders `QueryBuilderLegend`.
Until now no TanStack arm rendered a series legend at all, so half the pairs above were comparing
a chart with a legend against a chart without one. The `*-legend-tanstack` arms close that, and
finding out how was the more interesting half.

**`@tanstack/charts` has `colorLegend`, `colorGradientLegend` and `interactiveColorLegend`, and
all three hang off `ChartColorOptions.legend` — a key that only exists once the chart declares a
chart-level `color:` scale.** A mark therefore has to take its paint FROM that scale. Eight of the
ten spikes do the opposite: they set a literal `stroke`/`fill` per mark, because Recharts' idiom is
one `<Line dataKey>` per series and these ports deliberately preserve that shape mark-for-mark.

So the split is structural, not stylistic:

| Chart                  | Package legend reachable? | Why                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| stacked bar            | **yes**                   | already groups by `z`; `barY` has a `color` channel, so `fill: (d) => colorFor(d.service)` becomes `color: (d) => d.service` plus a chart-level domain/range |
| heatmap, trace scatter | yes (already used)        | continuous `color:` scale — but a gradient ramp, not a series key                                                                                            |

`stacked-bar-legend-scene-tanstack` is the one arm where both are reachable, which makes it the
only place the two can be priced against each other — see the second test in
`charts-lab.perf.spec.ts`. What the in-scene legend buys: zero DOM. What it costs: no Tailwind,
no shared styling with the tooltip, `ChartLegendPlacement` is `'top' | 'bottom'` only (production's
`legend="right"` is not expressible), and no stats columns.

**Two things about that arm are sharp enough to be worth the whole exercise.**

_Declaring both `z` and `color` produces a legend that silently filters nothing._ `barY` derives
its series from `color` only when `z` is absent (`dist/bar.js:27`), and sets `seriesFromColor` only
when `z` is absent AND the layout is grouped or the x positions repeat (`dist/bar.js:50`).
`interactiveColorLegend`'s `filterMark` short-circuits on `seriesFromColor`. Declaring both — the
obvious reading, since `z` is exactly what the DOM variant uses to stack — gives a legend that
renders, toggles, updates `aria-pressed`, and removes nothing. Dropping `z` fixes it; the stack
then groups by the colour channel instead.

_And on a stack it punches a hole rather than restacking._ `filterMark` runs on the RESOLVED
scene, after `stackValues` has assigned every segment its y1/y2, and there is no hook between the
layout and the filter to re-run it. So hiding the bottom band deletes its rects and leaves the
survivors floating at their old offsets, with a gap along the baseline — verified in the browser,
and the reason that arm pins its y domain to the full total (a domain over the visible services
would crop a picture that still occupies its original height). **For a stacked chart the package's
legend is a display control, not a data control** — which on current evidence rules it out for the
query-builder bar chart. The DOM arm sidesteps the whole question by highlighting instead of
hiding: nothing is removed, so nothing needs restacking.

`interactiveColorLegend`'s state model is the good part and worth stealing regardless:
`controlledSignal(value, onChange)` is explicitly "application-owned state described to the chart"
— it creates no store and no subscription of its own, so the visible set is plain React state
exactly as the DOM legend's hidden set is. Note `seriesVisible` "keeps hidden series in scale
inference while removing their scene output", which is right for a colour scale and wrong for a y
axis: the y domain still has to be re-pinned by hand.

The DOM legend is `lab/bench/tanstack/chart-legend.tsx`, a compound component
(`ChartLegend.Provider/Row/Column/Items/Item/Swatch/Label`) with `useChartLegendHighlight`
alongside. State lives with the chart, not the legend, because emphasis is expressed in the marks.

**Clicking a series highlights it; it does not hide it.** This is a deliberate departure from
`QueryBuilderLegend`, which toggles visibility, and it is the better interaction on every chart
here for the same underlying reason: removing a series changes the geometry of everything else.
On a line chart the y domain re-derives and the axis jumps. On a pie, `pie()` renormalises every
remaining angle, so the whole donut rearranges around the slice you just clicked. On a treemap,
`squarify` reruns and every surviving tile changes both size and position — the reader loses the
mosaic they were reading. On a sankey, dropping edges shrinks the derived node set and the columns
move. Highlighting leaves all of it in place and just quiets the rest, so a series can be picked
out of a crowded chart without losing its context. Clicking the same item again restores full
strength.

**How emphasis is expressed is a package constraint, not a preference.** `fillOpacity` and
`strokeOpacity` are flat `number`s on every mark in the package — `bar.d.ts`, `area.d.ts`,
`polar.d.ts`, `hierarchy-treemap.d.ts`, `line.d.ts` all declare them that way — while `fill` and
`stroke` are `VisualChannel`s. So it splits:

- **line, area** draw one mark per series, so a flat `strokeOpacity`/`fillOpacity` on that mark
  already is per-series. No colour arithmetic.
- **stacked bar, pie, treemap, sankey** draw every series from ONE mark, so there is no per-datum
  opacity to reach for and a muted series has to be a muted _colour_. That is `muteColor` in
  `lab/charts/color-scale.ts`, mixing toward `--background` with the `mixOklch` machinery the
  heatmap ramp already needed — for the same reason it needed it, that canvas takes literal colours
  and cannot resolve a `color-mix()`.

The single-mark charts express it without a new prop at all: they already paint through a
`colorFor(key)` lookup, so the legend variant hands down a `colorFor` that returns muted colours.

**The pie carries a second, transient interaction on top of that**, and it is the closest arm in
the lab to its production counterpart. Hovering grows the slice under the cursor to 1.035 and fades
the rest to 0.55 — production's own numbers — via `onFocusChange` plus a second `radialArc`; see
the correction to finding 3 above. Clicking a legend row pins a persistent emphasis instead. Two
interactions, different in kind and readable together: transient hover, persistent pin.

Its legend is also the only `Column` in the lab rather than a `Row`, matching production's
`legend="right"`, and the only one carrying figures — `LegendSeriesSpec.value`/`.secondary` are
**preformatted strings**, because the legend has no idea whether a column is a span count or a
latency and `formatValueByUnit` belongs with the chart that does.

Worth noting against the package's own legend: `interactiveColorLegend` can only _hide_ — its
contract is a `visible` array and a `filterMark` that deletes scene output. There is no emphasis
mode, so the interaction the spikes settled on is not expressible through it even on the one chart
where it applies.

**Not ported: the Min/Max/Mean/Last stats table.** `QueryBuilderLegend`'s stats variant reads
`Record<string, unknown>` rows by key; the spikes have closed per-chart row types and accessor
channels. It is a data-shape coupling, not a rendering one, and porting it would mean giving every
spike an index signature — the exact thing `pie-spike.tsx` documents as poisoning `Omit`/`keyof`
across the package.

Two things fixed in passing, both the same bug: `pie-spike` coloured slices by
`palette[slice.index % palette.length]` and `treemap-spike` by first-seen order over the rows it
was handed. Both are indexes into a _filtered_ list, so hiding one slice or service renumbered
everything after it and recoloured the chart. Colours are now keyed by name over the full row set.
A legend that repaints the series it did not touch is worse than no legend.

### The docs audit: three of our "gaps" are documented features (2026-08-18)

Prompted by "is there an example in the docs?", every workaround in this pilot was re-checked
against the published guides. Three of them existed because nobody read them.

**1. d3-scale is the documented upgrade path, not a last resort.** The
[Scales and D3 guide](https://tanstack.com/charts/v0/docs/concepts/scales-and-d3) is explicit:
the compact scales cover "numeric linear, categorical band and point, and ordinal mappings without
a production D3 dependency", and you install `d3-scale` when you need more. Its own examples are
`scaleLog().domain([200, 30_000])` and `scaleUtc` — the exact two scales this lab hand-rolled.

`histogram-spike.tsx` had reasoned itself out of this: d3-scale _is_ in the bun store transitively
via Recharts, `require.resolve` fails from `apps/web`, "so importing it would mean adding a
dependency". Adding the dependency was the answer. The guide even anticipates the confusion —
"Do not declare a D3 module merely because another package uses it internally" — i.e. declare it
because _you_ import it, which we now do.

`d3-scale@4.0.2` + `@types/d3-scale` are direct deps of `apps/web`, `lab/charts/log-scale.ts` is
deleted, and the box plot, histogram and trace scatter use `scaleLog()`. Two things got better for
free: d3 supplies proper log `ticks`/`tickFormat` (the trace scatter now labels clean decades
instead of the 1/3-mantissa set the hand-rolled version emitted), and `invert` — which `hexbin`
requires and which was the fiddliest part of the hand-rolled scale.

Factory-vs-instance applies, and the first version of this paragraph got it exactly backwards.
`isScaleFactory()` is `typeof source === "function" && !("copy" in source)`, and **`copy` lives on
the instance, not on the factory function** — `"copy" in scaleLog` is `false`, `"copy" in scaleLog()`
is `true`. So a bare `scaleLog` is read as a FACTORY and infers its domain from the data, exactly as
the docs' `x: { scale: scaleUtc }` example relies on. Calling it is a deliberate choice to pin a
domain, not a defensive one; the log charts here call it because they each want a domain the data
alone would not give (`[1, max]` for counts, a padded `[min, max]` for the box plot, a fixed
estimate for the density ramp).

**2. Bug 4 is not a bug.** "`areaY` strokes the whole outline incl. baseline" was filed as a defect
worked around with a fill-only `areaY` plus a `lineY`. That composition is the documented pattern —
the [Lines and Areas](https://tanstack.com/charts/v0/docs/examples/lines-and-areas) examples layer a
filled interval mark with a separate centre line for exactly this reason. Nothing to change; the
table entry was miscategorised.

**3. Continuous colour has a documented shape we did not use.** `lab/charts/color-scale.ts` is 248
lines of hand-rolled oklch parsing, hue interpolation and a bespoke `ConfiguredScaleLike`. The
[Legends and Color guide](https://tanstack.com/charts/v0/docs/guides/legends-and-color) says to
compose `scaleSequential` from d3-scale with an interpolator. **Not yet changed** — see below.

### 4. A real time scale on the timeseries x axes

Line and area used `scalePoint` over ISO **strings** — categorical, which is what Recharts does and
why axis labels landed on arbitrary buckets (`08:25 PM, 08:45 PM, 09:05 PM`) instead of on clock
boundaries. They now use a d3 temporal scale, and the ticks land on quarter hours
(`09:00 PM, 09:15 PM, 09:30 PM…`). `TimeseriesSpikeRow` carries a precomputed `date: Date` beside
`bucket`; `bucket` stays because the production Recharts arms and `markIncompleteSegments` both
parse it.

Three things worth keeping:

- **`scaleTime`, not the docs' `scaleUtc`.** `formatBucketLabel` renders ticks in local time via
  `toLocaleTimeString`, and only local-time ticks land on locally round boundaries — UTC ticks would
  read `:15`/`:45` in a fractional-offset timezone. The docs example is UTC because it assumes a UTC
  formatter; the rule is that the scale and the formatter have to agree.
- **The tick formatter fails silently, not loudly.** `formatBucketLabel` opens with
  `if (typeof value !== "string") return ""`. The moment the x channel yields a `Date`, the axis
  keeps its ticks, its spacing and its layout — and every label becomes an empty string. Ticks now
  round-trip through `value.toISOString()`, which is the same code path the string buckets took.
- **`Date`, not epoch milliseconds.** The runtime throws
  `"A temporal scale factory requires Date channel values"` on numbers (`dist/scale-input.js`);
  `ChartValue` is `number | string | Date`.

The x domain is no longer pinned. It was pinned because the solid and dashed marks cover different
slices, but that hazard was about categorical union ORDERING — a continuous scale takes min/max over
the union, which is order-independent, and the slices overlap at the bridge row anyway.

### 5. Continuous colour is d3's `scaleSequential` with our own interpolator

`createSequentialColorScale` now returns `scaleSequential` / `scaleSequentialLog` with the pinned
domain, in place of a bespoke `ConfiguredScaleLike` implementing `copy`/`domain`/`range`/`ticks` and
a `log1p` normaliser. The oklch machinery stays and is the point: `scaleSequential` accepts **any**
`(t: number) => string`, so Maple's theme ramps go in as a closure over `usePlotColors`-resolved
literals. d3's own interpolators (`interpolateBlues`) could not — they are fixed palettes, and
`d3-scale-chromatic` was not added.

The line count barely moved (277 → 273). That is not the win: what was deleted is scale
_semantics_ we were maintaining ourselves, and the header comment grew to hold the evidence below.

**The gradient legend was the risk, and it survives.** `colorScaleKind` is
`return scale.ticks ? "continuous" : "categorical"` after ruling out
`quantiles`/`thresholds`/`invertExtent` (`dist/scales.js:135`). In d3 4.0.2, `sequential()` is
`linearish(transformer()(identity))` and `sequentialLog()` is `loggish(transformer())` — both gain
`ticks`/`tickFormat` and carry none of that trio, so both classify continuous and
`colorGradientLegend` renders. Verified in the browser on the heatmap (amber ramp, `Count 3…142`)
and the trace scatter (`Spans per bin 1…90`), light and dark.

Worth knowing: **`@types/d3-scale`'s `ScaleSequentialBase` omits `ticks` entirely.** Classification
is a runtime property probe, so the types say nothing about whether the legend will work — a place
where trusting the type definitions would have given the wrong answer in both directions.

Two behavioural notes:

- **d3 does not clamp by default**, and the trace scatter depends on clamping: its density domain is
  a fixed estimate (the transform reduces after layout, so the real max is unknowable at definition
  time) and out-of-domain counts must saturate the top stop rather than run off the ramp.
  `.clamp(true)` on both branches.
- A log transform cannot include zero, so a non-positive minimum is floored to 1. The old file
  claimed `scaleSequentialLog` "throws on a domain touching zero" — it does not throw, it silently
  degenerates through `Math.log(0) = -Infinity`, which is why this is a floor and not a `try`.

### Still open after the audit

Nothing. `interactiveColorLegend` was resolved separately and decided **against** — see the legend
section above: it is a display control, not a data control, and on a stack it punches a hole.

### Bug 6 was never a bug, and believing it cost us a mount flash (2026-08-18)

The table above carried "`<Chart>` needs explicit `width`/`height`" from the 0.6.4 notes, and
`tanstack-chart.tsx` acted on it: a `useMeasuredSize` hook that observed the container and rendered
`null` until it had both numbers. That is the opposite of how the component is meant to be used, and
it is what made every chart flash blank for ~100ms on load.

What the package actually does, all of it verifiable in `node_modules`:

- `width` is **optional**. The host renders `width: width === undefined ? "100%" : width`
  (`dist/react/RendererChart.js`), so omitting it makes the chart fill its container.
- The renderer installs **its own `ResizeObserver`** on the container (`dist/renderer.js:151`).
- `adapter.mount()` runs inside a **layout effect**, and `createScene()` reads
  `container.getBoundingClientRect().width` synchronously there (`dist/renderer.js:659`) — so the
  first paint is already correctly sized. The `initialWidth: 640` prerender is the SSR placeholder,
  replaced before paint on the client. That default is what the 0.6.4 note mistook for "no
  intrinsic sizing".

Gating on our own observer broke exactly that: `observe()` never calls back inline, so the sequence
was mount → paint an empty card → first record arrives in a later frame → re-render → paint the
chart. Two blank frames minimum, twenty-one charts on the gallery, each with its own delivery and
its own React commit.

The guide says this plainly — omit `width` to follow the container, and choose `height` **or**
`aspectRatio`, never both: <https://tanstack.com/charts/v0/docs/guides/responsive-charts>

`height` genuinely does have to be a number, and that part is not a workaround: the scene height
comes from `options.height ?? 320` and is never read back off the container
(`dist/renderer.js:664`), so a CSS `height: 100%` yields a full-height host drawing a 320px scale.
These charts sit in a flex column whose spare height depends on whether a legend wrapped, so it is
measured — synchronously in a layout effect, with a fallback so rendering is never _gated_ on the
measurement. Width is left entirely to the package.

**The transferable lesson:** the two workarounds in this file that were pure cost — this one and
the `"currentColor"` hover ring — were both cases of trusting a note in this document over the
installed source. `node_modules/@tanstack/charts/dist` ships readable JS and full `.d.ts`; the
package is pre-alpha and its notes go stale faster than its code.

## 3. Migration cost for the other 46 files

Two couplings are load-bearing and neither is small:

- **`useLinkedCursor`** (`apps/web/src/hooks/use-linked-cursor.tsx:31`) locates every plot rect via
  the `.recharts-cartesian-grid` selector, and throttles Recharts' tooltip store to 30 Hz by
  `stopPropagation()` in the capture phase — exploiting the fact that Recharts listens in the
  bubble phase. Neither survives a renderer swap. TanStack does ship a first-class replacement
  (`cursor?: ChartCursorBinding` on the chart definition, an app-owned cursor shared across
  definitions), so this is a rewrite onto a better primitive rather than a loss — but it is a
  rewrite, and `infra.perf.spec.ts` / `service-detail.perf.spec.ts` assert the current behaviour
  down to sub-pixel cursor alignment.
- **`ChartTooltipContent`** (`packages/ui/src/components/ui/chart.tsx:425-506`) consumes Recharts'
  `active` / `payload` / `coordinate` props and feeds `ChartFloatingTooltip`. Everything below it
  (`ChartFloatingTooltip`, `useChartTooltipFollow`) is already renderer-agnostic; the adapter layer
  is what needs replacing.

Not counted above: the 15 `chartRegistry` entries, `metrics-grid.tsx`'s `syncMode` switch, and the
`overlay` prop (commit deploy markers) which currently passes Recharts children straight through.

## 4. Verdict

**Perf: go.** Canvas wins on the axis that matters and it is the only path that can — Recharts has
no canvas renderer at all. The 2026-08-05 revert was made on a metric that turned out not to be
the one users feel.

**Timing: not yet.** Still `0.x`, still labelled _"pre-alpha and its API may change between
releases"_, and 8 minor releases landed in the 10 days before this test. Bug 2 alone would force
a data-layer restructure that we would then be carrying against a moving API.

**Recommendation:** keep this bench, don't migrate. Re-run `test:perf:tanstack` when either the
pre-alpha label comes off or grouped focus lands across marks — whichever is later. The pilot is
committed and dev-only, so re-checking costs one command instead of another week-long spike.

---

### Unrelated production bug found in passing

`errorRate` is a **fraction**: the warehouse computes `countIf(StatusCode = 'Error') / count()`
and `apps/web/src/routes/index.tsx:368` documents it as one. `error-rate-area-chart.tsx` agrees
(`formatErrorRate` multiplies by 100; the y domain clamps to 1).

`throughput-area-chart.tsx:96` does not — it computes `errorThroughput` as
`(throughput * errorRate) / 100`, treating the fraction as if it were a percentage. **The error
overlay on the `/` overview's Request Volume chart is therefore 100× too small**, which is why it
renders as a flat line pinned to the axis.

Not fixed here — out of scope, and both arms of this bench inherit the same behaviour, so the
comparison is unaffected.
