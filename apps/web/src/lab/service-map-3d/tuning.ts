/**
 * The 3D map's spatial and optical constants, in one place so the lab can put
 * them behind dials.
 *
 * Split out of `layout.ts`/`scene.tsx` rather than left as module constants
 * because they are exactly the numbers you want to feel your way to: how far
 * apart storeys have to sit before the plumbing reads, how much frame the graph
 * should fill, how fast a packet has to move to look like traffic rather than
 * decoration. Dependency-free, so `layout.test.ts` keeps running in jsdom.
