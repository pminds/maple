/**
 * The catalogue of dev-only lab surfaces under `/lab`.
 *
 * Two families live here: **labs** are visual galleries that render a component
 * family over fixture data (widgets, provenance nodes, trace views), **benches**
 * are the synthetic perf harnesses the Playwright gates in `perf/` drive. All of
 * them are 404 in production builds — the `/lab` layout route throws `notFound()`
 * outside `import.meta.env.DEV` — and everything under `src/lab/` is forbidden
 * from the startup bundle by `perf/check-bundle-budget.ts`.
 *
 * `registry.test.ts` asserts this list and the route tree agree, so adding a
 * file under `src/routes/lab/` without an entry here fails the test rather than
 * silently missing from the `/lab` index page.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free at runtime: `src/lib/public-routes.ts` imports it
 * and `main.tsx` needs that before the router exists. The route-tree import is
 * type-only so a typo in `path` is a typecheck error, not a dead link.
