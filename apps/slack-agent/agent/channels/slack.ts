/**
 * Multi-workspace, self-managed Slack app — no Vercel Connect.
 *
 * The Slack signing secret is per-app/static (`SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`); only the
 * *bot token* varies per workspace. So we:
 *   1. Verify every inbound webhook's v0 signature with the static secret in a
 *      custom `webhookVerifier`.
 *   2. Resolve the outbound bot token per team via Maple's resolve endpoint.
 *      Our patched eve (patches/eve@0.25.3.patch, tracking vercel/eve#222)
 *      passes `{ teamId, channelId, threadTs }` into the credential;
 *      `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is the fallback for single-workspace dev and
 *      context-less paths.
 *
 * Slack delivers events to POST /eve/v1/slack.

/**
 * Stands in for eve's default mention/DM pipeline: same two steps — a
 * "Thinking..." typing indicator and workspace-scoped auth derivation — plus
 * the conversation around the mention as turn context.
 *
 * The context is ours rather than the channel's `threadContext` option because
 * eve reads a message's content from `text` alone and treats every bot post as
 * the agent's own last reply. Maple's alert notifications are Block Kit inside
 * an attachment with no top-level text, so both rules misfired at once and an
 * @mention in an alert thread reached the model with the alert blank and
 * everything before it cut away — see #lib/thread-context.js.
 *
 * Exactly one of the two loads produces anything, and which one is structural:
 * a mention inside a thread gets the thread transcript, a mention that starts
 * its own thread gets the channel's last few messages (#lib/channel-context.js)
 * — the case where the user @-mentions the bot under a pair of alert cards
 * without replying in either one's thread. The model cannot ask for context it
 * has never been shown a trace of, so this cannot wait for it to notice.
 *
 * The turn also carries the clock (#lib/turn-time.js). Nothing else in the
 * prompt does, and without it the model took the oldest `message_ts` in the
 * transcript for "now" — so a follow-up an hour into an alert thread charted
 * the alert's window instead of the current one.
 *
 * Runs after eve has already returned 200 to Slack (`waitUntil`), so the Slack
 * fetches are off the webhook's delivery budget. That is also why the thread
 * follow-up decision lives here rather than in the verifier: this handler
 * already loads the thread, and here it can take as long as it needs. It must
 * not otherwise throw: eve drops the whole mention when this handler does, so
 * both loads degrade to no context instead — the deliberate throws are the
 * two follow-up drops below (disengaged / not addressed to the bot), which is
 * exactly what that escape hatch is for.
