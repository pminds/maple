/**
 * Relevance gate for promoted thread follow-ups: should the bot answer this
 * reply at all?
 *
 * `#lib/thread-follow-up.js` answers a *mechanical* question — is the bot part
 * of this thread — and once it is, every human reply in the thread dispatched a
 * full agent turn. In an incident thread where two engineers are talking to
 * each other, that meant the bot answered every one of their messages: a cost
 * amplifier and, worse, a bot that butts into conversations that were never
 * addressed to it.
 *
 * So an engaged follow-up now has to pass a second, *semantic* question before
 * it becomes a turn: given the thread, is this reply directed at the bot or
 * does it expect the bot to act? A small classifier call decides — one model
 * round-trip with no tools, orders of magnitude cheaper than the agent turn it
 * gates. Real @mentions and DMs never come here: an explicit address is the
 * user answering this question themselves.
 *
 * The gate runs on the dispatch path (post-200, inside eve's `waitUntil`), so
 * it spends nothing from Slack's webhook budget, and it runs *before* the
 * `:eyes:` ack and the typing indicator — a message the bot decides not to
 * answer gets no reaction at all, exactly like one it was never going to
 * answer. A pass is silent by design: the bot staying out of a conversation
 * between humans must not announce itself.
 *
 * **It fails open**, same asymmetry as `confirmThreadFollowUp`: when the
 * classifier errors, times out, or answers gibberish, the follow-up is
 * answered. A wrong drop loses a user's message with nothing on screen to
 * explain it; a wrong answer costs one turn in a thread the bot was already
 * part of. The tiebreak inside the prompt leans the same way.
 */

 * Bound on the classifier round-trip. Past it the reply is answered without a
