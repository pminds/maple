 * threads `{ teamId, channelId, threadTs }` into eve's `botToken` credential
 * (upstream vercel/eve#222 leaves it arg-less).
 *
 * This is the failure mode worth catching: the patch does not break loudly
 * when it stops applying. Without it, `resolveBotToken` is called with no
 * context, `context.teamId` is undefined, the per-team lookup is skipped, and
 * every workspace's outbound calls fall through to whatever `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`
 * happens to be set — failing OPEN onto the wrong credential rather than
 * erroring. The pinned `"eve": "0.25.3"` (exact, not caret) is what keeps a
 * lockfile refresh from dropping the patch; these tests prove the pin held AND
 * that the patched code path is the one actually loaded.
