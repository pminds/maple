/**
 * The channel around the mention: the top-level messages posted just before the
 * one the agent is answering.
 *
 * `#lib/thread-context.js` covers a mention *inside* a thread. It cannot cover
 * the case in the screenshot that motivated this file: Maple posts two alert
 * cards to a channel, and someone writes "the ship is sinking help my friend
 * @Maple" as a new channel message rather than as a reply in either alert's
 * thread. That mention is its own thread root, so the thread transcript is one
 * message long — the user's own — and the model answers with no idea that two
 * incidents are sitting directly above it.
 *
 * Two entry points, because "the agent notices it needs context" only works
 * when the agent can tell there is any:
 *
 *   1. **Eager** (`loadChannelContext`, wired in `#channels/slack.js`): a
 *      mention that is not in a thread carries the last few channel messages
 *      as `<slack_channel_context>`. Structural trigger, no model judgment —
 *      the model cannot suspect what it has never been shown.
 *   2. **On demand** (`readChannelHistory`, behind the `read_channel_history`
 *      tool): for a mention inside a thread, where the thread is the subject
 *      but the channel may hold the reason.
 *
 * `conversations.history` returns top-level messages only — thread replies stay
 * out unless they were also sent to the channel — so the two surfaces do not
 * duplicate each other.
 *
 * DMs get the same treatment, and want it more: an unthreaded DM is its own
 * session (eve keys them `channelId:threadTs`), so without this each message a
 * user sends starts from nothing.
 *
 * Scope-wise this is free: `channels:history` / `groups:history` / `im:history`
 * are already installed for `#lib/thread-follow-up.js` and eve's thread fetch.
 * `mpim:history` is NOT requested, so a group DM answers `missing_scope`; that
 * degrades to a note, not a failure, and adding the scope would make every
 * existing install report missing scopes until it is reinstalled.
