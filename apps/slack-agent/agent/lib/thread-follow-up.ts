/**
 * Thread follow-up promotion: lets users keep talking to the bot in a thread
 * without re-@-mentioning it on every message.
 *
 * eve's Slack channel only dispatches `app_mention` events and DMs
 * (`message` with `channel_type: "im"`); a plain reply in a channel thread
 * arrives as a `message.channels` / `message.groups` event and is dropped as
 * `unsupported` before any handler runs. Rather than patching eve's parser,
 * we exploit the fact that our custom `webhookVerifier` returns the body eve
 * parses downstream: a thread reply that *could* be a follow-up gets its
 * `event.type` rewritten to `"app_mention"` so eve treats it exactly like a
 * mention — same session (continuation token is `channelId:threadTs`), same
 * incremental `threadContext`, same event-id dedupe.
 *
 * **The promotion is optimistic, and that is the whole design.** Deciding
 * whether the bot is actually engaged in a thread needs the thread, and the
 * verifier is the only awaited work before eve's 200 — so anything it fetches
 * is spent out of Slack's ~3s delivery budget. Two production incidents came
 * out of deciding there, both surfacing as the bot going completely silent:
 *
 *   1. **Restart.** The engagement cache is in-memory and a deploy wipes it, so
 *      the first follow-up after one paid the full cold-cache round-trip
 *      (workspace resolve + `conversations.replies`) inside the budget, blew the
 *      2s promotion deadline, and was dropped. Observed: a webhook that took
 *      exactly 2009ms, no turn, no log, not even the `:eyes:` ack — three
 *      minutes after the bot's own last post in that same thread.
 *   2. **Delay.** Engagement expired after 30 minutes, and the
 *      `conversations.replies` fetch derived its `oldest` bound from that same
 *      constant. So for a reply 61.3 minutes after the bot's last post, the
 *      fetch window *started 31 minutes after the bot had last spoken*: the
 *      check could not see the bot's own messages and could only ever answer
 *      "not engaged". The webhook completed in 406ms — no timeout, just a
 *      confident wrong answer.
 *
 * Widening the window would have made (1) worse (a longer window is a heavier
 * in-budget fetch), so both are fixed the same way: **promote first, confirm
 * afterwards.** `promoteThreadFollowUp` is now synchronous and network-free —
 * it parses, decides the event is a plausible candidate, registers it as
 * pending, and rewrites the type. `confirmThreadFollowUp` then runs from
 * `#channels/slack.js`'s handler, which eve invokes inside `waitUntil` *after*
 * the 200, against the thread that handler already loads for turn context. No
 * second Slack fetch, no deadline, nothing on the webhook's budget.
 *
 * A reply is a **candidate** when ALL of:
 *   - it is a threaded `message` in a channel/group (not a thread root, not a
 *     DM — DMs already dispatch on their own);
 *   - it is user-authored (no `bot_id`, no subtype except `file_share` —
 *     mirrors eve's own DM filter, and keeps the bot's replies from
 *     re-triggering itself);
 *   - it does NOT already @-mention the bot (those arrive as a separate,
 *     real `app_mention` event; promoting the `message` twin would double-
 *     dispatch the same turn).
 *
 * It is **confirmed** when the bot is engaged in the thread — it has posted
 * there, or someone mentioned it there — and both bounds below still hold.
 * Unconfirmed follow-ups are dropped by the handler throwing (eve's
 * `dispatchInboundMessage` catches handler failures and abandons the turn),
 * and the user is told why over DM (`#lib/disengage-notice.js`) when the bot
 * had actually been working in that thread.
 *
 * Requires the Slack app to subscribe to `message.channels` (public) /
 * `message.groups` (private) bot events. The bot only receives channel messages
 * for channels it is a member of, which naturally bounds the event volume.
 */

/**
 * Engagement expires. Without a bound, one @mention makes every later human
 * reply in that thread — by anyone, forever — dispatch a full agent turn: a
 * cost amplifier and a permanently open prompt-injection intake on a thread
 * that has long since moved on to something else.
 *
 * Two bounds, both must hold:
 *
 *   - **The thread is not dormant.** Measured from the message immediately
 *     before the reply, NOT from the bot's last post. That distinction is the
 *     fix for incident (2): a thread where people are still talking is a live
 *     conversation whether or not the bot has said anything lately, and an hour
 *     of human back-and-forth is a normal shape for an incident thread. What is
 *     genuinely over is a thread nobody has touched for a day.
 *   - **The bot's engagement is within the trailing 15 messages.** This is the
 *     real guard, and the one the clock was always a poor proxy for: a thread
 *     that ran away from the bot has moved on regardless of how recently it
 *     did so.
 *
 * Past either bound the reply is dropped, the humans in the thread get a DM
 * saying so, and re-@-mentioning the bot is one keystroke.
