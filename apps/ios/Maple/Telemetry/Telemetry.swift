/// This app's own instrumentation, in one place.

/// Maple's iOS SDK auto-instruments two things: `URLSession` requests, and
/// `UIViewController` appearances. In a SwiftUI app the second one finds
/// nothing — every screen is a `UIHostingController`, which the SDK skips as
/// framework scaffolding — and the first one produces a *root* span per
/// request. So a dashboard load that fans out thirteen calls arrived as
/// thirteen unrelated traces, and a recording had no timeline beside the video.
///
/// Everything below exists to fix that: a name for each screen, a parent span
/// for each load, and spans over the work that happens between screens (launch,
/// auth, a tapped notification, a background widget refresh).
///
/// Conventions, in the order they win:
///
///  1. An OTel semantic-convention key if one exists (`error.type`).
///  2. The SDK's own spelling if it already emits the concept (`screen.name`).
///  3. `maple.app.*` for anything that is only meaningful inside this app —
///     the vendor namespace the rest of the platform uses (`maple.ingest.*` in
///     the Rust gateway, `maple.dashboard.*` in the API).

/// the warehouse filters on; the SDK renders `SpanStatus` for us, so nothing
