				"Maple is an observability platform for distributed systems. It ingests traces, logs, and metrics over the OpenTelemetry protocol (OTLP), stores them in ClickHouse, and gives engineers a single place to search, correlate, and alert on them — distributed tracing with a service map, log search, metrics dashboards, error tracking with issue grouping, session replay for browser and mobile apps, Kubernetes monitoring, and alerting to Slack, email, and webhooks.",
				"There are no proprietary agents. Any application already instrumented with an OpenTelemetry SDK, collector, or auto-instrumentation can point its OTLP exporter at Maple and start sending data; switching observability vendors means changing an endpoint and a key, not re-instrumenting.",

			paragraphs: [
				`Maple ships a hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) server at \`${API_ORIGIN}${API_PATHS.mcp}\` and a documented, stability-committed REST API (\`${API_ORIGIN}/v2\`), so coding agents and automation can list services, search traces and logs, find and triage errors, build dashboards, and manage alert rules against production telemetry. The website itself serves a markdown twin of every page (append \`.md\`, or send \`Accept: text/markdown\`), indexed at [llms.txt](${SITE_PATHS.llmsTxt}).`,
