/**
 * `/llms.txt` — the index that makes the `.md` twins discoverable.
 *
 * `public/robots.txt` already opts every AI crawler in by name; this tells them
 * where the machine-readable copy of the site lives. One section per content
 * family, each stating the `.md` convention in prose and giving one worked
 * example URL, so a model can generalize the pattern from a single fetch.
 *
 * Only URLs that actually resolve go in here. A dead link in the index is worse
 * than an absent section.
