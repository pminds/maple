/**
 * `/brand.md` — the markdown twin of the brand page.
 *
 * This is the twin most likely to be fetched by something that is not a person:
 * "what colour is Maple's brand, and where do I get the logo" is a question an
 * agent gets asked while writing a README or a slide. So the asset table gives
 * absolute URLs — a relative path is useless once the file has been copied out
 * of here, which is the entire point of the twin.

			"Geist for headings, Geist Mono for body copy — the monospace body is deliberate, not a code-block rule. The wordmark is Geist Medium at -0.02em tracking, shipped as outlines so it needs no font installed. Both faces are under the SIL Open Font License.",

			"## Usage",
			blocks(
				'- **Don\'t fill the mark with a gradient.** The eyes and the notch beside the trunk are knockouts in one `fill-rule="evenodd"` path, so a gradient reaches them at a different value and they stop reading as eyes.',
				"- **Don't put the rounded tile inside your own chrome.** The tile exists to survive a browser tab strip; on a surface that already has an edge it is a box around a box. Use the bare mark.",
				'- **Don\'t rebuild the wordmark** by setting "Maple" in another face next to the mark. Use the outlined lockup.',
				"- **Don't stretch, rotate, or recolour.** Scale uniformly and pick a colourway above; if none clears your ground, use mono white or mono ink.",
				"- **Do keep clear space** of at least half the mark's width on every side.",
				"- **Do respect the 16px floor** for the bare mark — below that its eyes antialias into a blob, so use the tile instead.",
			),

			"## Terms",

				'Maple\'s source is FSL-1.1-ALv2, and each release converts to Apache 2.0 two years after we publish it. Neither one hands over the name or the artwork. The FSL says so in its own words, and Apache repeats it in its section 6. So a fork gets every line of the code and none of this page: ship it under your own name and your own mark. Saying what it is stays fine. "A fork of Maple", "built on Maple", "compatible with Maple" are all true, and none of them needs asking.',
				"What isn't fine is looking like us when you aren't: Maple in your product name, domain, or handle, or the mark placed so it reads as endorsement or partnership where there's no agreement. We can ask you to stop, and if we do, please stop.",
