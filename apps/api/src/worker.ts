/**
 * The api Worker in alchemy's single-module form: this file is the resource
 * the root stack yields (`yield* MapleApi`) and the init the deployed isolate
 * runs. Stage-derived props read `MapleStack`; `impl` runs once per isolate,
 * on the first event, and yields the pieces the Worker hosts and serves —
 * each in its own module under `./worker`. The bridge builds the telemetry
 * into every event's scope and flushes it after: the request path as
 * `maple-api`, background work under its own service names (`eventTelemetry`).
 *
 * The bundle entry is the one alchemy generates around this module: the
 * default export is the Worker, and the chat Durable Object and the two
 * Workflows are alchemy classes the init yields — their bindings, the
 * namespace, the physical workflows and the entry's class exports all derive
 * from those yields.
