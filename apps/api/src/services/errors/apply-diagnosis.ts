/**
 * The writes that publish a diagnosis onto an investigation.
 *
 * Two callers reach this: `InvestigationService.submitDiagnosis` (the chat
 * agent's tool, on the single-pass path) and the fan-out workflow's `persist`
 * step (the validator's promoted cause). They must produce byte-identical
 * effects — the same status transition, the same severity application, the same
 * deterministically-keyed timeline event — or an investigation would mean
 * different things depending on which path produced it.
 *
 * Autumn metering deliberately stays with each caller: they reach the worker env
 * differently, and the token totals they have to report differ (one pass versus
 * a summed fan-out).

 * hold one (the request path, the fan-out workflow's per-run scope) keep using
 * exactly that connection.
 *
 * The body below stays a Promise callback because that is the shape
 * `Database.execute` takes — drizzle's `transaction` is a Promise API and there
 * is no Effect-native equivalent in this repo. Wrapping it here is what keeps
 * the seam at one place per logical call rather than at every call site.
 *
 * Fails with the raw `DatabaseError` rather than a domain persistence error:
 * this write straddles two domains (it updates `investigations` and, when an
 * issue is linked, the error-issue tables), and its two callers map to
 * different persistence errors. Mapping here would force one of them to
 * re-wrap. The contention retry still applies — that lives in `makeDbExecute`,
