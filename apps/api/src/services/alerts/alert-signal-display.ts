/**
 * How an alert rule's measured quantity is named and unit-formatted in outbound
 * notifications.
 *
 * `signalType` alone is NOT that name. It is the rule's *query kind*, and two of
 * its members — `builder_query` and `raw_query` — say only "this rule runs a
 * query", not what the query measures. Printing the enum verbatim produced Slack
 * messages reading "builder_query is 1041923". The measured quantity for those
 * two lives in the rule's `queryBuilderDraft` / `rawQueryReducer`, which is why
 * this resolves from the rule rather than from the enum.
 *
 * The unit travels with the label because the two are decided by the same facts:
 * a traces `p95_duration` query is milliseconds, `error_rate` is a ratio, and a
 * metrics query is an unknown unit that must render as a plain number. Deriving
 * them separately is how the observed value and its threshold drift apart.
