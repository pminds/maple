/**
 * The series behind an alert notification's sparkline and chart.
 *
 * The source is `alert_checks` — the audit row the scheduler already writes on
 * every evaluation — rather than a fresh warehouse aggregation. Three reasons,
 * in order of how much they matter:
 *
 *   1. **It is what the alert saw.** A re-derived series can disagree with the
 *      number printed one line above it in the same message, and a chart that
 *      contradicts its own alert is worse than no chart.
 *   2. It is a `list` scan over rows keyed by the rule, not a re-aggregation
 *      of raw telemetry.
 *   3. It carries `Status` per row, so "was this point breaching" needs no
 *      re-run of the comparator.
 *
 * `alert_checks` is written through `warehouse.ingest` (pinned to managed
 * Tinybird for every org) and `listRuleChecksQuery` declares `.route("ingest")`,
 * so both halves resolve the same pipeline — this works for BYO-ClickHouse
 * orgs too, and needs no second code path. See
 * `packages/query-engine/src/ch/queries/alert-checks.ts`.
 *
 * Nothing here is allowed to fail a notification. Every entry point returns
 * `null` instead of an error: a chart is an enrichment, and a page that is late
 * because a warehouse read was slow is a worse outcome than a page with no
 * picture on it.
