// SWR rather than a hard TTL because expiry used to mean *block*, and blocking
// here is disastrous: the read sits synchronously in front of every widget
// query on a dashboard. Production traces over 7 days measured 1079 blocking
// resolutions at a p50 of 2547ms — one of them 6020ms, in a request whose two
// actual ClickHouse queries took 135ms and 158ms. The config it was fetching
// changes only on BYO-CH onboarding/rotation.
//
//   now <  freshUntil  -> serve, no work
//   now <  hardUntil   -> serve the stale value AND refresh in the background
//   otherwise          -> block on Postgres (cold isolate, or a memo so idle
//                         that no background refresh ever completed)
//
// The SOFT TTL is what bounds staleness. Every write through this service busts
// the memo AND the shared edge-cache entry, but the memo only in the isolate
// that served the write — other isolates converge by re-reading at the soft TTL
// (which now hits the shared entry, not Postgres). That degree of staleness is
// safe because the warehouse executor self-heals on `WarehouseAuthError`: it
// calls `invalidateRuntimeConfig` and retries once, so a credential rotation
// costs the first request one extra round-trip instead of costing the org every
// request until the entry ages out.
//
// The HARD ceiling is not a staleness bound — it is an isolate-lifetime backstop.
// A background refresh is best-effort: it is forked into the triggering request's
// scope and interrupted if that request finishes first (see
// `refreshCachedSettings`). Without a ceiling, a pathological isolate serving
// only sub-refresh-length requests could serve one value forever. It is set well
// past a typical Workers isolate lifetime so that the blocking read happens once
// per cold isolate and never again — a bursty dashboard workload (idle isolate,
// then a widget fan-out) must not pay it on the first query of every burst, with
// the rest of the fan-out queued behind it.

		 * Refresh a stale memo entry without making the caller wait for it.

		 * Forked into the *triggering request's* scope, never detached. This is the

		 * fiber that outlives its request and then touches a socket it opened there
		 * fails with "Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request".
		 * `Effect.forkIn(scope)` guarantees interruption when the request scope
		 * closes, so every socket this fiber opens is opened and consumed inside the
		 * request that created it.
		 *
		 * Interruption is a no-op for correctness: the memo is written only on
		 * success, so an interrupted refresh leaves the stale entry exactly as it
		 * was and the next request tries again. The work is a ~26ms Postgres read
		 * racing warehouse queries that take an order of magnitude longer, so it
		 * lands well before the scope closes in practice.
		 *
		 * `waitUntil` is deliberately NOT used: the worker never passes Cloudflare's
		 * `ExecutionContext` into the Effect graph (see `worker.ts`), and reaching it
		 * through a module-scoped mutable would register one request's refresh on
		 * another's context — manufacturing the very hazard above.

		// missing range — so this must not block. A module-scoped in-isolate memo
		// answers it with zero network, and past its soft TTL it keeps answering
		// from the stale value while a background fiber refreshes it.
		//
		// Behind the memo sits ONE shared tier, on the Workers Cache API. Two
		// earlier attempts at this were reverted, and the difference is worth
		// spelling out, because the naive reading of that history ("a shared cache
		// cannot work here") is too strong and would rule out the case it does fix.
		//
		// The first attempt (a 1h edge-cache entry) measured, over 7 days: 241
		// completed reads at a span p50 of 26ms, against 1079 abandoned at the 40ms
		// deadline costing a p50 of 2547ms — because `cache.match()` cannot be
		// cancelled, so the abandoned read kept holding one of the Worker's six
		// connection slots and the Postgres fallback queued behind it. The second
		// (#387) moved the tier to Workers KV on the theory that a KV `get` is a
		// cancellable subrequest; it was worse (92ms completed vs 6ms on the Cache
		// API, 79% still hitting the deadline) and `apps/alerting`, which was most
		// of the volume, has no KV binding at all.
		//
		// What actually drove that 82% abandonment was CONCURRENCY WITHIN ONE
		// REQUEST, not the tier. A `cache.match()` occupies one of the six
		// connection slots while it waits for headers, so the timeout rate scales
		// with how many reads a single request issues — measured at 8.4% for one
		// read and 35.9% for four (see `DEFAULT_EDGE_CACHE_READ_TIMEOUT_MS`). The
		// org-config bucket was being read 22 times in a single alerting request
		// (106 traces doing 22 resolutions each, half of all of them). Those reads
		// congested each other, and each abandoned one held a slot the Postgres
		// fallback then queued behind.
		//
		// That fan-out is gone: `AlertsService` now calls `primeRuntimeConfigs` to
		// resolve the whole set in one statement, and the HTTP query paths call
		// `warehouse.warmRoute` once per request before fanning out. What remains is
		// the opposite shape — a dashboard load fires 5-17 parallel requests that
		// land on DIFFERENT cold isolates, one config read each, before any
		// warehouse `fetch()` is holding a slot. Measured in bursts of 17, 9, 9, 9,
		// 8, 8 blocking reads in a single second. A per-isolate memo cannot help
		// across isolates and neither can `warmRoute`; a shared entry can, because
		// the first isolate to resolve populates it for the rest.
		//
		// So: one read per request, issued before the warehouse queries. Do NOT
		// reintroduce a per-org cache read inside a fan-out — prime instead.
		//
		// The read deadline is deliberately left at the default. Raising it looks
		// tempting given how expensive `compute` is here, but the latency
		// distribution is bimodal, not long-tailed: a read that will succeed has
		// done so by ~20ms, the entire 40-249ms band is 0.5% of reads, and anything
		// past that is hung rather than slow. A longer deadline would buy almost no
		// extra hits and charge the full deadline to every hung read.
		//
		// `skipReadWhenSlotsHeld` because this bucket's timeouts are exactly the
		// reads issued while other outbound I/O holds a connection slot — a shape
		// the per-isolate breaker can never learn, since each isolate reads this
		// bucket at most once per memo window (measured: the most timeouts of any
		// bucket, zero breaker skips). With `compute` a ~20ms indexed row read,
		// skipping straight to Postgres beats a 40ms deadline gamble that loses
		// 27% of the time at a p50 of 621ms per loss.
