/**
 * Validating the one input a share link's holder genuinely controls.
 *
 * A viewer may change dashboard variable values — that is the point of a live
 * share rather than a snapshot. But those values are interpolated into stored
 * query params, and `interpolateWhereClause` in
 * `@maple/query-engine/dashboard-variables` substitutes them **raw**: only the
 * `sql` key gets escaping, because in the authenticated app the person setting
 * a variable is the same person who could edit the where-clause anyway.
 *
 * On a share link that assumption is gone. The holder is not the author, so an
 * unchecked value lets them rewrite the clause grammar and widen a filter the
 * author pinned — a board published as "service = frontend" turned into every
 * service in the org. Org isolation still holds regardless (`validateTenantScope`
 * is independent and unaffected), so this is a within-org confidentiality
 * boundary, not a cross-tenant one. It still matters: the whole proposition of
 * a scoped share is that the scope holds.
 *
 * Two defences, deliberately layered:
 *
 *   1. Enumerated variables must name a value the stored definition allows.
 *      Exhaustive, and the strong one.
 *   2. Free-text variables get a conservative charset AND a clause-count
 *      assertion. The charset is a guess about a grammar this module does not
 *      own; the clause count is a direct check on the thing that must not
 *      change. Either alone would be weaker than both.
 *
 * `query` variables sit across both. Their options are whatever the warehouse
 * returns right now — the route lists them server-side over the batch window
 * (`DashboardWidgetDataService.variableOptions`, the same facet / attribute
 * queries the signed-in provider runs) — so with a list they get defence 1 and
 * with a source that listed nothing they get defence 2. What they must never
 * get is an *empty* list treated as an exhaustive one — that rejects every
 * value including the board's own stored default, which blanks the share.
 *
 * Which value a variable takes when the viewer picked none is not decided
 * here: `resolveDashboardVariableValue` (`@maple/query-engine`) is the board's
 * own ladder — selection → default → All → first option — shared with the
 * signed-in provider, so a share resolves to what the board resolves to.
