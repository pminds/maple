			/**
			 * The widgets' half of an incident.
			 *
			 * A Home Screen widget refreshes itself when WidgetKit wakes it, which
			 * is on a budget derived from how often it is looked at — somewhere
			 * between twenty and sixty times a day for a widget in use. That is
			 * good enough for "how is the fleet doing" and much too slow for "an
			 * incident just opened", which is the one moment the numbers on a Lock
			 * Screen are most wrong.
			 *
			 * So an incident sends one background wake-up per phone. The app is
			 * given a few seconds, reloads the timelines, and the widget fetches.
			 *
			 * Three limits worth stating plainly, because this looks more powerful
			 * than it is:
			 *
			 * - **It is a hint.** iOS throttles background pushes on an
			 *   unpublished schedule and drops them freely. Nothing may depend on
			 *   one arriving; the widget's own refresh is the mechanism, and this
			 *   only makes it timely.
			 * - **It reaches only phones that accepted notifications.** A device
			 *   row exists because push registration created it, so a user who
			 *   declined alerts and pinned a widget gets the ordinary refresh and
			 *   no wake-up. That is inherent to APNs, not a gap to close here.
			 * - **It rides the alert budget.** This is called from the incident
			 *   fan-out, which is already bounded per tick and per rule, so a
			 *   forty-service breakage cannot turn into forty wake-ups.
			 *
			 * Every device the organization has, not just the ones that wanted the
			 * banner: notification preferences say which events are worth
			 * interrupting someone for, and a widget refresh interrupts nobody.
