// Live introspection of the `defineDatasource` exports in

// both raw-SQL datasource scoping and the MCP discovery tool, keeping the
// security allowlist and agent-visible schema derived from the same source.
//
// Type strings (`String`, `DateTime64(9)`, `LowCardinality(String)`,
// `Map(LowCardinality(String), String)`) come straight from the SDK's
// `getTinybirdType()`. Curated notes — enum casing, unit warnings, sort-key
// hints — live in the TABLE_NOTES record below; the type system can't infer
// them but they cause the most expensive agent mistakes.

Where you must use text, use `upper(SeverityText) = 'ERROR'`.",

		"Sorting key starts with `(OrgId, ServiceName, Timestamp)` — filter on these first.",

	ai_trace_index: [
		"GenAI agent spans ONLY (every row carries a non-empty `VendorId`), with the `maple_ai.*` identity pre-extracted to plain columns. ALWAYS prefer this over `traces` + `mapContains(SpanAttributes, 'maple_ai.…')` for finding agent traces/sessions — the raw-traces scan reads the full attribute Map per span and times out on day-plus windows.",
		"`SessionId` is '' on most rows: vendors stamp the session key only on turn-owning spans. Resolve a trace's session as `max(SessionId) GROUP BY TraceId`, and treat a trace whose max is '' as a sessionless single-trace session.",
		"`DeploymentEnv`, `Model`, `AgentName` and `ToolName` are the span's environment and GenAI identity, coalesced across dialects at insert (`gen_ai.*`, Vercel AI SDK `ai.*`, OpenInference `llm.*`/`tool.*`).

		"`IsLlmCall`, `IsToolCall`, `IsError` (UInt8 flags), `Tokens`, `Cost` (Float64) are the span's kind, failure and reported usage; `SpanId`/`ParentSpanId`/`Duration` are its own. `Tokens` is the span's billed total under the reporter's own convention — a prompt figure that already contains its cached tokens (OpenAI, OpenRouter, Gemini) or a completion figure that contains its reasoning is NOT double counted, so it can read below `input + cache_read + output + reasoning` summed off the raw attributes. Sum per session here for calls, failures, tokens and cost — but a wrapper span often repeats its children's usage, so subtract a child reporter's tokens from its parent (`ParentSpanId = SpanId`) before summing, or the total doubles.",

Only cumulative rows (temporality 2) need the window function above.",
		"`maple_ingest_org_bytes_total` / `maple_ingest_org_items_total` are delta counters written under Maple's internal org, carrying `Attributes['org_id']` (the *tenant* org whose data was ingested) and `Attributes['signal']` ('logs' | 'traces' | 'metrics'). Bytes are the real decoded payload size metered to billing — divide by 1e9 for GB. Sum them; never rate them.",

		"`Hour` is a top-of-hour DateTime. Snap both range bounds to their hour floor (`toStartOfHour`) or sub-hour windows return no rows at all; this necessarily over-reports at the window edges.",
		"The `*SizeBytes` columns are STORAGE ESTIMATES, not measured bytes — the materialized views compute them as `length(Body) + 200` (logs), `length(SpanName) + 300` (spans) and flat per-point constants (metrics). They will NOT reconcile with an Autumn invoice and must never be presented as billed usage.",
		"For real billed bytes use `metrics_sum` / `maple_ingest_org_bytes_total`, which records the decoded payload size the gateway actually metered. Counts here are also post-sampling and post-drop, i.e. what was stored, not what was accepted.",
