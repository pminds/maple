// SAFETY-FILE: JSON in this test is emitted by the fixture or unit under test before its fields are asserted.
// Write-filter/read-guard sync for `ai_trace_index`.
//
// The rollups doc records the failure mode this exists for: a materialized
// view whose write filter and read fast-path agree with each other and
// disagree with reality sits at 0 rows forever, and every SQL-text test still
// passes (`span_metrics_calls_hourly` did exactly that). Agent Sessions
// detection reads `ai_trace_index` exclusively, so an MV that never fires
// renders the page permanently empty while looking healthy.
//
// So this suite proves rows, not text: it inserts vendor-stamped spans into
// `traces` on a database built by replaying the real migration chain, then
// asserts the MV materialized them — per column, because a `TO`-table view
// maps by NAME, so what the write filter admits and what each alias resolves
// to are facts only a real insert settles — and finally runs the real compiled
// list query end to end over the same data.
