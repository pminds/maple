// SAFETY-FILE: JSON in this test is emitted by the fixture or unit under test before its fields are asserted.
// Raw-vs-rollup parity for the service-overview tiers.
//
// The services list reconstructs its window from up to three sources at once:
// exact raw rows for the two partial boundary buckets, `service_overview_minutely`
// for the sub-hour remainder, and `service_overview_hourly` for the whole-hour
// interior. Correctness rests entirely on those tiers TILING the window — covering
// it exactly once, with no gap and no overlap.
//
// That property cannot be checked by reading the SQL. A `<=` where a `<` belongs
// double-counts a bucket; a `<` where a `<=` belongs drops one. Both produce a
// perfectly plausible chart. The only proof is running the spliced query and a
// ground-truth scan of the same rows and comparing the numbers.
//
// The failure modes this is shaped to catch:
//
//   - A boundary inequality inverting. Spans are seeded EXACTLY on
//     `firstFullMinute`, one second before it, on `endMinuteFloor`, on
//     `firstFullHour`, and one second before `endHourFloor`. A tiling bug is
//     invisible unless a row sits precisely on the seam.
//   - The hourly tier answering a sub-hour bucket. An hour-floored row carries no
//     position inside the hour, so it would pile a whole hour of traffic onto the
//     bucket containing `:00`. The 300s cases below would show one spike per hour.
//   - `serviceOverviewQuery` averaging quantiles instead of merging tDigest
//     states. The skewed-namespace seed exists so a weighted mean and a real p95
//     cannot coincide.
