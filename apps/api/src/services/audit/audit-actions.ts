 * Every audited action in Maple, grouped by the resource it acts on.
 *
 * The key is both the `resource_type` stored on the row and the `<resource>`
 * half of the `<resource>.<verb>` action string, so the two can never disagree.
 * `prefix` is the public-ID prefix the resource's internal ID is encoded with;
 * resources that are org-singletons (`ingest_key`, `anomaly_settings`) or carry
 * no resource at all (`api`) omit it, and passing a `resourceId` for one of
 * those is a type error.
 *
 * Adding an entry here is what makes `record({ action: "<resource>.<verb>" })`
 * compile — a typo, or an action recorded before it is declared, fails the build.
