/**
 * A headless pass must always be able to report what it found.
 *
 * This is the regression file for the defect that made investigations look lazy:
 * the turn loop's closing step was written for attended chat, where the answer is
 * prose, and sent `tools: []`. A pass whose answer *is* a tool call therefore
 * could not answer once it hit its step cap or its deadline — `runAgentPass`
 * returned `None`, the workflow recorded a `no_finding` lane, and an agent that
 * had investigated for its entire budget was indistinguishable from one that
 * never looked.
 *
 * The three cases below are the whole contract: out of steps still submits, out
 * of clock still submits, and genuine silence is still reported as silence.
