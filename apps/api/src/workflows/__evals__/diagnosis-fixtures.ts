/**
 * Four incidents with planted ground truth.
 *
 * Each one is a *world*, not a prompt: what the telemetry says, and — just as
 * importantly — what it does not say. That second half is what the fixed lens
 * catalogue could never model. A world with no `service.version` attribute is a
 * world where a deploy hypothesis is unanswerable, and the whole point of the
 * planner's sweep is to notice that before spending a pass on it.
 *
 * The fourth fixture is the most valuable and the least obvious: a real symptom
 * with nothing behind it. The correct answer there is "unknown", with a list of
 * what was checked. Every other fixture can be passed by a model that guesses
 * confidently; only this one catches the failure the whole rework is about.
