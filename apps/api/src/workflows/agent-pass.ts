/**
 * Running one registered agent to a structured answer, headlessly.
 *
 * The loop is `chat/loop`'s — the same `runChatTurn` the attended conversation
 * uses, with the same retry, context pruning, step budgets and permission
 * gating. Nothing here re-implements a turn; this is only the seam that lets a
 * Cloudflare Workflow drive one and collect a typed result.
 *
 * Two things a workflow needs that a chat session gets for free:
 *
 * - **A structured answer.** The turn emits events, not objects, so the schema
 *   arrives the way `submit_diagnosis` already does: the turn's `completion`
 *   tool, whose `parameters` *is* the schema. The model filling it in is the
 *   model answering.
 * - **A deadline.** `softStop`, checked between steps. This used to ride on
 *   `isCurrent`, which looked like the same thing and is not: `isCurrent` is the
 *   *abort* hook, so a pass that ran out of clock returned an empty stream, never
 *   reached a closing step, and therefore never called its submit tool. A lane
 *   that had investigated for its entire budget was recorded exactly like one that
 *   never looked. `softStop` means "finish by answering", and the loop responds by
 *   spending one last step on the forced submit call.
 *
 * Both of those depend on `completion.closes`: the tool-less closing step that
 * serves attended chat has nothing to say for an agent whose answer *is* a tool
 * call.
