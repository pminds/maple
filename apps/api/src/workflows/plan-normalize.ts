/**
 * Turning what the planner said into what the workflow can actually dispatch.
 *
 * Kept pure, and separate from the agent that produces the plan, for one reason:
 * this is where every "the model said something unusable" case is decided, and
 * each of those decisions is a rule someone will want to argue with. A rule you
 * can read as a table and test without a model is a rule that stays honest.
 *
 * The load-bearing one is rule 3. A hypothesis is never dispatched with an empty
 * allowlist — that is the mechanical form of the lesson `config_flags` taught: a
 * lane asking a question its tools cannot answer does not report "inconclusive",
 * it reports a confident guess, and the validator then has to rank a
 * confabulation against real findings.
 *
 * What rule 3 no longer does is *drop* on the first failure. Production showed
 * the cost: a model that gets its tool vocabulary wrong gets it wrong uniformly,
 * so "drop the hypothesis" became "discard the whole plan" and roughly seven
 * runs in ten dispatched three standing category probes at an incident nobody
 * had read. The rule now repairs — seed tools, then a generic rescue set — and
 * drops only when no real tool can be found at all. Every repair is a `note`, so
 * a reader can still see that the planner named nothing that exists.
