/**
 * Planned investigation workflow logic — the body the alchemy Workflow class in
 * `./InvestigationFanoutWorkflow.ts` runs, over alchemy's `task` primitive.
 *
 * Step layout:
 *   1. claim           — replay guard, fix the deadlines
 *   2. plan            — scope the incident, write hypotheses, seed one lane each
 *   3. hypothesis-<n>  — N concurrent evidence passes, one per hypothesis
 *   4. validate        — rank the candidates, promote at most one (SKIPPED when the plan collapsed)
 *   5. seed-transcript — reconstruct a readable thread in the chat session
 *   6. persist         — publish the diagnosis, or record that nothing held
 *
 * Rules the workflow engine imposes, each of which has bitten somebody:
 *
 * - **Clocks are read inside steps, never in the body.** A clock read in the
 *   workflow body returns something different on every replay, which silently
 *   invalidates every cached step result downstream of it. Both deadlines are
 *   computed once inside `claim` and ride out on its cached result.
 * - **A lane step never fails.** Its Effect is total — every cause becomes a
 *   `no_finding` lane — and the step itself wears a second belt that turns
 *   "retries spent" into an empty lane result. Otherwise one exhausted lane would
 *   take the whole instance with it — exactly the "one slow lane loses the entire
 *   investigation" outcome the design forbids.
 * - **Step names never derive from model output.** Lanes are named by *ordinal*,
 *   so the alphabet is `{hypothesis-0 … hypothesis-4}` no matter what the planner
 *   writes. The ordinal→hypothesis mapping is read back from the rows `plan`
 *   wrote, which is the same discipline `validate` uses: read lanes from
 *   Postgres, not from step return values, because a step whose result was lost
 *   to a retry boundary still wrote its row.
