/**
 * The unauthenticated share surface, served at `/v2/share`.
 *
 * Deliberately has no authorization middleware — the only group on `MapleApiV2`
 * without one; see `packages/domain/src/http/v2/share.ts` for what that costs
 * and why it is still right. A public link must resolve with no credential at
 * all, and an org-only link needs the session resolved *optionally*: middleware
 * would reject an anonymous caller before any handler could see which mode the
 * link is, so the page could never tell "sign in to view this" from "this link
 * does not exist".
 *
 * Note this means the v2 API-key rate limiter never runs for these routes.
 * `enforceRateLimit` below is not a supplement to it — it is the only limiter
 * on this path.
 *
 * Uniformity is the security property throughout: an unknown token, a revoked
 * token, and a token whose dashboard was deleted all take the same path and
 * produce the same body, so nothing here is an oracle for whether a given token
 * ever existed.
