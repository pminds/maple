/**
 * The one read behind the iOS Home Screen widgets.
 *
 * Composed here rather than by the client, because the client is a WidgetKit
 * timeline provider with seconds of wall clock: what used to be four requests
 * (`/v2/error_issues`, `/v2/services`, and two `/v2/traces/timeseries`) is one.
 * See the contract in `packages/domain/src/http/v2/widget-summary.ts` for why
 * this is its own resource family and not a shaped view over those.
 *
 * The windows are built here from constants, never from the caller — which is
 * also why this route validates none of them. `parseWindow` and
 * `validateTimeseriesBucket` exist to turn a *caller's* bounds into a 400, and
 * wiring them in would put three unreachable telemetry errors into a public
 * contract whose only consumer is a widget that cannot act on any of them.
 *
 * The two halves are not independent the way the app's old publisher made them:
 * one response means an issues failure also costs the caller its throughput.
 * That is the accepted trade, because the caller renders its last good snapshot
 * on any failure — a widget never shows an error, it shows an honest age.
 * The *series* are the exception and degrade in place: a sparkline is a nicety
 * next to the scalars it sits under, so a timeseries read that fails leaves
 * `bucket_seconds` null and the points empty rather than costing the summary.
 */

/**
 * Latency baselines are a service-health signal the widgets do not render, and
 * loading them is a second warehouse round-trip per request. `toService` omits
 * the baseline fields entirely for a service it has no baseline for, which is
 * exactly the shape wanted here.
