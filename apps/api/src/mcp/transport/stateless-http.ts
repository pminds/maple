/**
 * Maple's stateless Streamable HTTP transport for MCP.
 *
 * Effect's `McpServer.layerHttp` keeps negotiated sessions in a Map created per
 * layer build — per isolate on Workers — and answers any request carrying a
 * session id it does not hold with a bare 404. A session issued by one isolate
 * is therefore unusable from the next, which is every request after
 * `initialize` on a Worker. The map is also never pruned on the HTTP path, so
 * each `initialize` leaks its session for the isolate's life.
 *
 * This transport keeps Effect's MCP server — the tools, prompts, resources and
 * protocol adapters are all still its own — and replaces only the seam that
 * carries sessions: `RpcServer.Protocol` plus the route that feeds it. Each
 * request is self-contained. When a client sends anything other than
 * `initialize`, we drive a synthetic `initialize` on the same ephemeral client
 * first, so the server has the negotiated profile it needs, and drop its reply
 * before answering.
 *
 * The server itself is run with `HttpRouter` omitted from its context, which is
 * the whole trick: `isHttp` is `serviceOption(HttpRouter)`, so without it the
 * server files sessions under the client id — which the disconnect finalizer
 * deletes when the request scope closes — instead of under a session id, which
 * nothing ever deletes, and it reads headers off the message rather than the
 * live request. No `mcp-session-id` is issued, so clients never send one back
 * and the 404 branch cannot be reached. See `statelessMcpServerLayer`.
