 * the exact JSON Schema the MCP surface publishes, and `callMcpTool` does its own Effect Schema
 * decode with the tool's own error messages. Decoding twice would only give the model a second,
 * worse phrasing of the same validation failure.
 *
 * The tenant is provided per call rather than ambiently so a loop can never widen its own scope:
 * every tool executes under exactly the org the turn was started for.
