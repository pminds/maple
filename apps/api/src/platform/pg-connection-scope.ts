/**
 * Cloudflare's documented value for postgres.js behind Hyperdrive.
 *
 * `max` is a CEILING, not an allocation: postgres.js opens a second socket only
 * when a second statement is genuinely in flight, so a request that makes one
 * DB call still costs one connection. That is why a single value serves both
 * the request path (mostly one call per invocation) and the cron path (a tick
 * issuing thousands).
 *
 * This was 1 for one day, on the theory that Postgres should reserve at most
 * one of the Worker's six outbound slots. Reserving is not what `max` does, and
 * capping it serialized every statement in a cron tick behind one connection —
 * measured on identical queries, `SELECT actors` p50 928ms -> 5687ms and
 * `INSERT alert_rule_claims` p50 536ms -> 2989ms at flat volume. Head-of-line
 * blocking cost far more than the contention it was avoiding.

/**
 * One dial attempt, bounded. No retry, no ladder.
 *
 * The bound exists for diagnosis as much as for latency: postgres.js only
 * raises `CONNECT_TIMEOUT` from `connectTimedOut()`, and its `timer()` is a
 * no-op when `connect_timeout` is unset — so with no bound a stalled dial hangs
 * for the whole invocation and lands with no `error.type` at all.
 *
 * 10s rather than the 2s that shipped briefly: 2s alone took production 5xx
 * from 0.06% to 5.01%, and the retry that followed existed only to compensate
 * for it. Dial latency is bimodal (p50 ~11ms, or dead), so a generous single
 * bound kills essentially only the dead ones.
