// The served response's identity, read off the wire and written to the
// model-call span.
//
// Every OpenAI-chat stream chunk carries the provider's response id and the
// model that actually served it (OpenRouter routes, so it can differ from the
// request). `@opencode-ai/ai`'s protocol keeps the stream's usage object and
// drops both — its finish event's `providerMetadata.openai` IS the usage — so
// `gen_ai.response.id` and `gen_ai.response.model` never reached the span.
// The id is the one fact a gateway's own trace of the call (OpenRouter
// Broadcast) shares with ours, and what Agent Sessions collapses the two
// observations on; without it every call through a broadcasting gateway
// counts twice for Maple's own sessions.
//
// So the HTTP client the executor runs through tees the response body, reads
// the first data frame off the copy, and stamps the enclosing model-call span
// — the one `turn.ts` opens per attempt. Nothing is buffered on the served
// branch and the copy is cancelled the moment the frame is in hand. The
// executor's own retries run inside that one span, so a retried attempt
// simply writes last. This is Maple behaviour at the `Llm.ts` seam, not a
// wrapper around the package — and it covers what goes out over `fetch`: a
// call the Workers AI shim answers from the binding never reaches it, and has
// no broadcasting gateway to be deduped against either.
