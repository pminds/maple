/**
 * Maple's seam onto `@opencode-ai/ai` — opencode's Effect-native LLM core.
 *
 * Everything Maple-specific about talking to a model lives here, never in a wrapper around the
 * package: the layer wiring, the Workers AI binding shim, provider/model selection from env, and
 * the mapping from the upstream `AIError` onto a Maple domain error.
 *
 * Two provider paths stay live at once — OpenRouter (default) and Cloudflare Workers AI — and
 * `MAPLE_LLM_PROVIDER` picks between them per deploy without a code change.
 *
 * Layer shape mirrors `CloudflareApi.ts`: `LLMClient.layer <- RequestExecutor.layer <- HttpClient`.
 * `RequestExecutor` already owns retry, backoff and secret redaction, so the HTTP layer underneath
 * is plain `FetchHttpClient.layer` — wrapped by the Workers AI shim, and by the response-identity
 * stamp (`ResponseIdentityHttpClient.ts`) that writes the served id and model to the model-call
 * span for what goes out over `fetch`, which the package's own protocol drops.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT imported here: `@opencode-ai/ai/providers/amazon-bedrock`. It is the only path
 * that reaches `aws4fetch` and `@smithy/*`; leaving it unimported keeps both out of the Worker
 * bundle. `providers/google-vertex` is out for the same reason — it pulls `google-auth-library`.
 * Providers are deep-imported for the same reason — never the `providers/index.ts` barrel.
