/**
 * The whole provider stack behind `VcsSourceService`, composed once.
 *
 * A composition root, which is what makes it the one place allowed to name a
 * vendor module — every other consumer takes this layer and stays provider-
 * agnostic. It exists because the errors side needs a source service in workers
 * that otherwise have no VCS wiring at all (the alerting worker), and rebuilding
 * the Github → provider → registry chain at each of those call sites would put
 * vendor imports in places the boundary lint rightly refuses.
 *
 * Requires `Env` and `Database` from the caller's own base layer.
