/**
 * Running one chat turn, inside the `ChatSession` Durable Object.
 *
 * This module is the heavy half of the DO: the Effect runtime, the app service graph and
 * `@opencode-ai/ai`. `ChatSession.ts` reaches it through a dynamic import for the same reason
 * `worker.ts` dynamic-imports its route graph — the static graph builds hundreds of Schema ASTs at
 * module scope, which would blow Cloudflare's ~1s startup-CPU budget (error 10021) on a class that
 * is exported from the worker entry.
 *
 * Two things changed shape when the turn moved in here:
 *
 *   - **Appends are method calls.** The turn used to run in the request that submitted the message
 *     and write back over the DO stub, one RPC per token delta. It now holds the object itself.
 *   - **`submit_diagnosis` resolves itself.** It used to be threaded in as a callback from three
 *     call sites, because `InvestigationService` starting an investigation's own turn would have
 *     made the service require itself through the Effect requirements channel. Here the turn builds
 *     its *own* runtime, so it just resolves `InvestigationService` — no cycle, and no
 *     `env: workerEnv ?? {}` fallback silently degrading the model config when a caller forgot to
 *     thread the worker env through.

/**

 * **One meter per turn, and this is it.** Two things used to bill the same tokens from different
 * angles: `submit_diagnosis` billed the running total it reports to `InvestigationService`, keyed
 * on the bare investigation id, so an investigation was charged exactly once however much it went
 * on to cost — every follow-up turn was free, and so was any turn that errored or ran out of steps
 * before reaching the tool. Suppressing this one in its favour lost the charge entirely, because a
 * superseding diagnosis deduplicates against the first. So the investigation still records its
 * tokens on the row, and this bills them, once, per turn.
 *
 * **Source and key follow the session.** An investigation session bills as `triage`, keyed
 * `<investigationId>:turn-<messageId>` — the `turn-` prefix keeps the key space disjoint from the
 * fan-out's `<id>:<attempt>` under that same source, where an unprefixed turn id could collide
 * with an attempt number and silently swallow a real charge. Every other session is an attended
 * chat turn and bills as `chat`, keyed `<sessionId>:<messageId>`. Either way the key carries the
 * turn, so a turn that somehow ran twice still meters once, and a restarted investigation's new
 * turn is real new spend that bills.
 *
 * `usage` is the turn's whole total: every step, every sub-agent (they share the parent's
 * accumulator), and the compaction that runs after the answer.
 *
 * **In a finalizer, not on the happy path.** A turn that failed, was stopped, or ran out of steps
 * is still billed for every step the provider actually served — the loop accounts a step's usage
 * before it checks whether the turn survived. Metering follows the spend, not the outcome. (A step
 * interrupted before the provider's terminal event reports no usage at all, so that much is
 * unbillable rather than unbilled.)
