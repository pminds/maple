/**
 * Which model-call failures a chat step retries, and how long it waits.
 *
 * Pure policy, deliberately separate from the loop that applies it. `./turn.ts` retries a
 * *stream*, so it needs the retraction machinery around the emitted deltas.

 * The ceilings this policy is applied under live in `./budgets.ts`, with every other limit the
 * loop enforces.
 *
 * ## Why this cannot just read `LlmCallError.retryable`
 *
 * `@opencode-ai/ai`'s `RequestExecutor` already retries — twice, capped at 10s — but it wraps
 * `executeOnce`, which resolves when *response headers* arrive. It cannot replay a stream that
 * died at token 400. That mid-stream case is the entire reason this module exists.
 *
 * And a mid-stream failure is not retryable at the call level. The route client's stream-level
 * `Stream.catchCause` surfaces it as either `Transport` (the fetch body died) or
 * `InvalidProviderOutput` (framing or decoding blew up), and neither is in the `RETRYABLE_REASONS`
 * set `platform/Llm.ts` classifies with. A classifier that stopped at `retryable` would retry only
 * what the executor already retried — it would look correct, pass a naive test, and do nothing.

/**
 * Reasons the upstream executor cannot cover, because they arrive after response headers.
 *
 * `InvalidProviderOutput` is the debatable inclusion: genuinely malformed provider output will fail
 * identically on every attempt and burn the whole budget. It is here because an interrupted body
 * also lands on it — the route client's `streamError` only looks for a `Fail` reason and falls
 * through to `eventError` otherwise — and `MAX_STEP_ATTEMPTS` bounds the waste to a few seconds.
 * Narrow this to `Transport` alone if it proves noisy in practice.
