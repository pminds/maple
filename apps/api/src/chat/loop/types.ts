 * turn's tool map, plus a `closingSubmit: { toolName }` naming which key of it closes the turn — and
 * nothing tied the two together. Every disagreement between them was silent and shipped: the
 * investigation chat session supplied `submit_diagnosis` and no closing name, so an investigation
 * that spent its whole step budget reached the tool-less closing step, answered in prose, and left
 * `investigations.diagnosis` null. A name with no matching tool was equally representable and simply
 * fell back to the prose closing step.
 *
 * Absent means the turn has no structured answer at all — plain attended chat. Present means exactly
 * this tool, under exactly this name, is offered to the model.
 *
 * `closes` is the remaining choice, and it is required rather than defaulted so no caller can make
 * it by omission:
 *
 *   - `true` — the turn's answer *is* this call. The step that closes a cut-short turn carries this
 *     one tool with `toolChoice` forcing it, a step that produced prose instead of calling it is
 *     asked once more through it, and the call itself ends the turn. Headless passes.
 *   - `false` — the tool is merely available. The turn closes in prose like any attended one, and a
 *     call to it is dispatched and then followed like any other tool result. This is what a human
 *     follow-up inside an investigation gets: it *may* file a superseding diagnosis, but a question
 *     about the existing one must not be answered by rewriting it.
 *
 * It is supplied by the caller rather than built inside the loop because its handler needs
 * `InvestigationService`, which would otherwise drag the service graph into the loop's imports.
