/**
 * Keeping a turn inside the model's context window, when bounding results at creation wasn't enough.
 *
 * Two different growth problems hide behind "the conversation got too long", and they want
 * different fixes:
 *
 *   - **In-turn.** `runStep` rebuilds the request as `[...messages, assistant, ...toolResults]` for
 *     up to `MAX_STEPS` steps at `TOOL_CONCURRENCY = 4`, and Maple's MCP tools return warehouse rows
 *     and trace payloads. This is where the tokens actually are, and it is what walks a single
 *     investigation into the wall.
 *   - **Cross-turn.** `toLlmMessages` in `turn-runner.ts` replays the transcript, but it already
 *     drops tool messages entirely and keeps only text, so it is comparatively small.
 *
 * ## Why this is now a fallback rather than the main defence
 *
 * This module used to truncate old tool results *in place*, mid-turn. That is the one shape the
 * default route cannot afford: OpenRouter (`z-ai/glm-5.3-flash:nitro`) gets no cache breakpoints from
 * `@opencode-ai/ai` (its route id is not in `RESPECTS_INLINE_HINTS`), so caching there is implicit-prefix and
 * prefix stability is the only lever. Rewriting a step-3 result diverges the prefix near the front of
 * the turn and voids everything after it — at exactly the moment the transcript is longest.
 *
 * Results are therefore bounded once, when they are created (`mcp/tools/tool-output.ts`), and the
 * transcript is append-only. What is left here is the case that survives that: enough bounded
 * results to still overflow. The answer then is to drop whole *steps* off the front rather than edit
 * any message — one clean break in the prefix instead of a rolling one, and it should almost never
 * run. An assistant turn leaves with its own tool results, so the transcript never ends up with an
 * orphaned result or a tool call whose answer vanished.

 * (The char-based token estimate that used to live here went with the pruner. It existed only to
 * decide whether a rewrite reclaimed enough to be worth its fidelity cost; dropping a whole step is
 * unambiguously worth it, and the trigger below reads the provider's reported count anyway.)
