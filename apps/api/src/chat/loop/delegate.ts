/**
 * `task` — delegating a self-contained question to a sub-agent.
 *
 * ## Why this runs in process, and not in a Durable Object of its own
 *
 * opencode's equivalent creates a real child *session* and re-enters the same loop against it. That
 * is nearly free there, because a session is an in-memory record in a long-lived process. On
 * Cloudflare it inverts: a child `ChatSession` DO would need a new addressing scheme that survives
 * all four session-id parsers (`orgIdFromChatSessionId`, `tabIdFromChatSessionId`,
 * `chatModeFromSessionId`, `investigationIdFromChatSessionId`), a distributed abort fan-out that
 * survives isolate eviction, and either cross-DO event mirroring or a second SSE stream per task —
 * all to solve a CPU-headroom problem the budgets below already bound.
 *
 * So the sub-agent runs *inside* the parent turn: `runChatTurn` calls itself, with a different
 * agent record and its own step budget. Three things fall out for free that the DO design would
 * have had to build:
 *
 *   - **Abort.** The child gets the parent's `isCurrent` closure verbatim, so clearing the turn
 *     claim stops both at their next step boundary.
 *   - **One log, one stream.** Child events are tagged with a {@link ChatTaskRef} and land in the
 *     parent's SQLite log, where `history()` folds them into a nested transcript.
 *   - **Replay.** `toLlmMessages` filters on top-level text, and child text lives nested inside a
 *     tool call, so the sub-agent's chatter never re-enters the next turn's context.
 *
 * The caps this respects — depth, fan-out, per-turn count — live in `./budgets.ts` alongside every
 * other ceiling, because they only make sense multiplied against the step caps.
 *
 * ## The context firewall
 *
 * The parent gets back the child's **final assistant text only**, never its tool payloads. That is
 * the entire point: delegation is how the model searches broadly without burying the conversation
 * in warehouse rows. A `task` that returned the child's transcript would be strictly worse than
 * just calling the tools inline.
