/**
 * The chat turn loop: one submission, driven to completion.
 *
 * This module is the control flow and nothing else. Every policy it applies lives next door and is
 * read here as a decision, not re-derived:
 *
 *   - `./budgets.ts`   — every ceiling: steps, attempts, backoff time, delegation fan-out, depth.
 *   - `./retry.ts`     — which failures are worth another attempt, and how long to wait.
 *   - `./stop.ts`      — when the model has stopped reacting to its own results.
 *   - `./context.ts`   — keeping the request inside the model's window.
 *   - `./delegate.ts`  — handing a sub-question to a sub-agent, which re-enters this loop.
 *   - `./types.ts`     — the input, the events, and one step's state.
 *   - `../tools.ts`    — what the model may call.
 *   - `../agents.ts`   — which agent this turn runs as, and what it is allowed to do.
 *
 * ## The shape of a step
 *
 * Stream the model → fold the events into an `LLMResponse` → settle the tool calls → build the next
 * request → recurse. Recursion rather than a `while` because each step's output is a `Stream` that
 * must be concatenated lazily: the next request cannot be built until the current step's tool
 * results exist.
 *
 * ## Approvals are a real interrupt
 *
 * Flue's event stream had no human-in-the-loop primitive, so `apps/chat-flue/src/lib/approval.ts`
 * swapped every mutating tool for one whose `execute` returned a `{ status: "proposed" }` marker
 * without mutating — a propose-then-apply stub the web client re-ran through `POST /internal/chat/apply`.
 * Here the loop simply *stops* on a gated call: it emits a `tool-call` with `proposed: true` and
 * ends the turn. Nothing fabricates a tool result, so the model is never told a mutation happened
 * when it did not. `POST /internal/chat/apply` is still how the approved mutation runs — the user's own
 * action, authenticated as the user, which is where it belongs.
