/**
 * The chat turn loop.
 *
 * Split out of the surrounding `chat/` directory so the control flow can be read on its own. The
 * rest of `chat/` is the world the loop runs in — the Durable Object that owns the log and the turn
 * slot, the agent registry, the permission rulesets, the prompt text, the tool set. None of that
 * decides how a turn *progresses*; all of it is input.
 *
 * Read in this order:
 *
 *   1. `turn.ts`     — the control flow. Start here; it is the only file that decides anything.
 *   2. `types.ts`    — the vocabulary: what goes in, what comes out, what one step carries.
 *   3. `budgets.ts`  — every ceiling, together, because they multiply against each other.
 *   4. `retry.ts`    — which failures earn another attempt.
 *   5. `stop.ts`     — when a turn has stopped making progress and should answer instead.
 *   6. `context.ts`  — keeping the request inside the model's window.
 *   7. `delegate.ts` — handing a sub-question to a sub-agent, which re-enters `turn.ts`.
 *
 * Callers should import from here rather than reaching into a file, so the internal split stays
 * free to move.
