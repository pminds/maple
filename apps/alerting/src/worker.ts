/**
 * The alerting Worker in alchemy's single-module form: this file is both the
 * resource the root stack yields (`yield* Alerting`) and the bundle alchemy
 * deploys (`main: import.meta.url`). Stage-derived props read `MapleStack`;
 * `impl` runs once per isolate, on the first event, and registers one handler
 * per cron. The ticks live in `./scheduled`, imported on the first fire so
 * the api layer graph stays off the startup path — and out of the deploy
 * process, where init also runs.
 *
 * Alchemy's cron source reports every fire as successful, so the platform's
 * retry never engages here. Nothing is lost: the ticks already log and
 * swallow their own failures (`catchTickFailure`), the schedules re-fire on
 * their own, and a failure outside a tick (the layer build) is logged below.
