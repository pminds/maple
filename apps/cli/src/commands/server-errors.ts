/**
 * Failures raised by the `start` / `stop` / `reset` / `checkpoint` / `restore`
 * commands.
 *
 * These used to be one `@maple/cli/ServerError` carrying nothing but a rendered
 * message. Grouping is by exception type first, so a bad `--host`, an unclean
 * store, a port already in use and a background boot that never came up all
 * landed in a single issue — and the CLI's error stream was one bucket nobody
 * could triage. The API has carried one tag per distinct failure for a while
 * (`@maple/http/errors/*`); this is the same taxonomy for the CLI.
 *
 * Each error carries the context that identifies the *situation* rather than
 * only the sentence shown to the user: which store, which policy, which port.
 * `message` stays because it is the remedy the user reads — `runMain` renders
 * it and the process exits non-zero, exactly as before.
 *
 * Errors that already had their own tag are no longer re-wrapped here: a bind
 * failure stays `ServerBindError`, a failed restore stays
 * `CheckpointRestoreError`. Re-wrapping them was what made the distinct tags
 * these modules already defined invisible in telemetry.
