// The CLI's remote backend: a typed client over Maple's public v2 API.
//
// Remote mode used to impersonate a warehouse — it POSTed a pipe name and
// params to `/api/tinybird/query` and let the server compile the query. That
// seam is gone. v2 is a resource API, so there is no generic
// `query(pipeName, params)` to implement; each operation names the resource it
// wants and maps the response into the shape the renderers already consume
// (see `operations.ts`).
//
// Auth is the token `maple auth login` already stores: a `maple_ak_…` API key
// minted with `kind: "standard"` and no scope restriction, which
// `ApiAuthorizationV2Layer` accepts across every `/v2` family.
