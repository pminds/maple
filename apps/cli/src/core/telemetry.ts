 * from a Maple worker running locally and, worse, from our own CI. Triaging the
 * CLI's error stream meant reading paths out of error strings to guess whether a
 * failure came from a user or a GitHub Actions runner.

 * and Buildkite alike. An explicit `MAPLE_ENVIRONMENT` still wins.

 *
 * On by default: ships with `DEFAULT_INGEST_KEY`, so telemetry flows to
 * `https://ingest.maple.dev` out of the box. Overrides:
 *   - `MAPLE_INGEST_KEY` — use a different ingest token (wins over the baked-in
 *     one; `config.ingestKey` takes precedence over the env var in the SDK, so
 *     we read it here).
 *   - `MAPLE_ENDPOINT` / `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` — redirect the export,
 *     e.g. at a running `maple start` to self-ingest and view in local-ui.
 * `shutdownTimeout` bounds the flush on exit so a slow or unreachable endpoint
 * never hangs a command.
