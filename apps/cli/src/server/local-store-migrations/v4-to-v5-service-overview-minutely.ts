 * Purely additive, exactly like v3 -> v4: one new table and the view that fills
 * it. Nothing existing is dropped or rewritten, so there is no pre-step.
 *
 * `service_overview_minutely` starts empty and fills forward only — a
 * materialized view is an insert trigger, so it sees nothing already in the
 * store. That is the same position a deployed cluster is in immediately after
 * migration 0015 on managed Tinybird, and it is bounded here in a way it is not
 * there: the minute tier is only consulted for windows under ~5 days, so the
 * store is self-sufficient again within days of the upgrade, and until then the
 * read path's hour tier and raw edge still answer. Backfilling would mean
 * rewriting a store we have just promised to clone byte-for-byte.
