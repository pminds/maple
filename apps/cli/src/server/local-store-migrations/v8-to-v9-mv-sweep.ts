/**
 * The local mirror of ClickHouse migration 0019. Four changes, one edge:
 *
 *  - `error_spans` and its view are dropped outright. Nothing read them.
 *  - `trace_detail_spans` loses its three `Events*` columns, via an explicit
 *    `ALTER ... DROP COLUMN`. Declaring the narrowed table in the v9 DDL is not
 *    enough — that DDL is `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so on an existing store
 *    it is a no-op and the wide v8 table survives verification as
 *    `unexpected column EventsTimestamp`. Same `IF NOT EXISTS` trap as the views.
 *  - The four attribute-value views gain a cardinality bound.
 *  - The span-metrics calls view starts matching the metric name the collector
 *    actually emits.
 *
 * Every one of these is forward-only. Rows already materialized keep whatever
 * the v8 bodies produced, and the targets converge as their TTL rolls — the same
 * position a deployed cluster is in right after migration 0019. Backfilling
 * would mean rewriting a store this edge has just promised to clone
 * byte-for-byte, and for `attribute_values_hourly` the whole point is that the
 * old rows are the ones we no longer want to keep.
