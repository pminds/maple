/**
 * Two changes land together, both confined to the error-events family.
 *
 * 1. The emitting build is added to `error_events`, `error_events_by_time` and
 *    `error_fingerprints_minutely`. This is the one step the bundled DDL cannot
 *    perform on its own: it uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, which is a no-op
 *    against a table that already exists, so an existing store would keep the v6
 *    column list. The explicit `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` is what actually
 *    widens it, and it is metadata-only — no part is rewritten and no row moves.
 *
 * 2. The three error views are dropped and recreated. A materialized view's
 *    SELECT is frozen at creation, so replacing the body requires a drop; same
 *    shape as v5 -> v6. Dropping a view never touches rows already in its target
 *    table.
 *
 * The new fingerprint (v2) matches stack frames by shape instead of by "contains
 * a colon-digit", which stops Drizzle `params:` lines and `Type: message`
 * headers being hashed as frames.
 *
 * Historical rows keep their v6 fingerprint and an empty build.
 * Recomputing hashes would re-bucket every existing local issue, and the stored
 * rows carry no resource attributes to recover the build from. Both effects are
 * forward-only and the stale rows age out with the tables' 90-day TTL — the same
 * outcome a deployed cluster gets, where the managed rollout also only applies
 * to newly materialized events.
