/**
 * Like v5 -> v6, this edge replaces the body of two existing views rather than
 * adding anything. A materialized view's SELECT is frozen at creation and the
 * bundled DDL uses `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS`, so both views must be dropped
 * before the v8 schema can install its versions. Dropping a view never touches
 * rows already in its target table.
 *
 * The new body adds an Apple alternative to the fingerprint's frame matcher.
 * Before it, no frame of an iOS crash matched any alternative, so `_fpFrames`
 * was empty and the hash fell through to the message signature — which redacts
 * hex and long digit runs, collapsing every crash of an exception type in a
 * service into a single issue.
 *
 * Historical `error_events` / `error_events_by_time` rows are left exactly as
 * they are: recomputing FingerprintHash would re-bucket every existing local
 * issue. Forward-only, converging as the retention window rolls, and matching
 * what a deployed cluster gets from ClickHouse migration 0018.
