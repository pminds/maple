# Infrastructure notes

Background for the Alchemy stack (`alchemy.run.ts` + `apps/*/alchemy.run.ts` +
`packages/infra`). The stack files keep the rationale a reader needs **in order not to
break the code**; the history behind those decisions lives here, so the config stays
readable and the incidents stay findable.

If you are about to delete a comment in a stack file because "the history is in git" —
put it here instead. Git blame does not survive a refactor of the line it annotates.

## Layout

- `alchemy.run.ts` — the root stack. Provides `MapleStack` (stage, domains, public URLs,
  the `bun dev` blocks) once, yields one module per app, and returns the deploy summary
  (also emitted as GitHub step outputs).
- `apps/<app>/src/worker.ts` — a Worker as one module: the alchemy Worker class the root
  yields, whose props are an Effect over `MapleStack`, and the bundle alchemy deploys
  (`api`, `alerting`, `electric-sync`, `web`, `landing`, `local-ui`; see "Single-module
  Workers" below).
- `apps/<app>/alchemy.run.ts` — a `create*` factory, only for the apps that are not
  Workers (`ingest`, `electric` on ECS). Owns that app's resources and nothing else's. The one
  api resource the ingest gateway shares (the replay bucket) is
  `apps/api/src/resources/replay-blobs.ts`.
- `packages/infra` — stage/region/domain/naming logic, the shared deploy-time env groups,
  and the few resources several Worker modules bind.
    - `cloudflare/stage.ts` — `MapleStage`, domains, worker names, Hyperdrive resolution.
      Pure functions, unit-tested, no cloud calls.
    - `cloudflare/stack.ts` — `MapleStack`, what the root stack tells the Worker classes.
    - `cloudflare/observability.ts` — the Workers Observability destinations, declared once
      and yielded from every module that binds them (alchemy registers a resource by id; a
      second yield returns the first's).
    - `aws/stage.ts` — `MapleRegion`, AWS naming, task sizing, Cloud Map.
    - `env.ts` — the deploy-time env primitives and the shared groups the workers spread.
    - `cloudflare/maple-db.ts` — `MAPLE_DB` in the stage's flavor (`MapleDb`, yielded from a
      Worker's init) and the runtime read of the binding (`readMapleDbBinding`).
    - `config-helpers.ts` / `cloudflare/worker-runtime.ts` / `cloudflare/workers-cache.ts` —
      the _runtime_ (in-Worker) side, each behind its own subpath export so a worker bundle
      never reaches the deploy graph through `./cloudflare`. `worker-runtime.ts` is the
      `WorkerEnvironment` tag (alchemy's key, typed `Record<string, unknown>`) and
      `workerEnvLayer(env)`, the env plus its `ConfigProvider` for a graph built over one
      env record — nothing reaches for `cloudflare:workers`.

**Read deploy-time config through `@maple/infra/env`, not `process.env`.** Alchemy resolves
config through a ConfigProvider built as `fromDotEnv(--env-file ?? ".env")` **orElse**
`fromEnv()` (`alchemy/Util/ConfigProvider.ts`), and never copies the file-sourced values
into `process.env`. A `process.env` read therefore silently ignores `.env` and
`--env-file` — and does so _selectively_, since alchemy's own settings
(`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CI`, …) still pick them up, so half the deploy sees the file and
half does not. `Config` also reports every missing key in one pass instead of throwing on
the first, and keeps the failure in the typed error channel. `packages/alchemy-maple`'s
`MapleEnvironment` is the same pattern inside a provider; the runtime worker env schemas
use `@maple/infra/config-helpers`, which `env.ts` builds on.

## Local dev: one `alchemy dev` stack

`bun dev` (`scripts/dev.ts`) runs the whole local stack as a single `alchemy dev`:

```bash
bun dev             # everything
bun dev api web     # a subset: api, alerting, electric-sync, web, landing, ingest, local-ui, scraper
```

The Workers — **api, alerting, electric-sync** — are served by alchemy's local runtime from
the same Worker classes that deploy them. Everything that is not a Worker — web, landing
and local-ui (vite/astro dev servers), ingest (`cargo run`) and scraper — runs as a
`Command.Dev` child of the same stack: each app's own `dev` script, started by
`createDevProcess` in `alchemy.run.ts`, kept alive across stack restarts, stopped with the
stack. `Command.Dev` is a no-op on a deploy, so this is dev-only by construction; the asset
Workers' deploy shape (`Command.Build` + assets Worker) never runs in dev.

Portless provides what alchemy's local runtime does not: named HTTPS hosts that several
worktrees share without anyone caring about ports. The routes are alchemy resources —
`Portless.Route` from `lib/alchemy-portless`, one per app the run serves (`createDevRoute`).
A route reserves a loopback port, registers `portless alias <hostname> <port>`, and removes
the route again when it is torn down: with the dev session, on a config change, or on
`alchemy destroy`. Its `port` attribute feeds a child process's `PORT` like any other Output;
a Worker binds its port at plan time (`Portless.workerDev`) and its route follows the Worker. The
provider lives in alchemy's dev sidecar, so a route survives a hot reload of the stack file.

**Ports are sticky, not pinned.** A route prefers a port derived from its identity (a hash
into 40000–49999; Workers use 50000–59999 so the two can never collide), walks forward if that
one is held (a second worktree running the same app), and only then takes an OS-chosen port. So `api` lands on the same port run after run
without anyone writing it down, and two checkouts never fight over one. Linked worktrees get
the branch-prefixed hostnames portless itself produces (last branch segment, none for `main`:
`fix-ui.api.localhost`), and
each non-Worker child is told its own name through `PORTLESS_URL`, which is how the
vite/astro configs find the api and ingest (`siblingUrl`).

What is left in `scripts/dev.ts` is a shim: `bun dev api web` → `MAPLE_DEV_APPS=api,web`, then
`alchemy dev`. A subset run still declares every resource (a resource absent from the plan
would be deleted from the account); it only leaves the other Workers unserved
(`dev: { mode: "external" }`) and starts no child process for them. The inter-app URLs are
handed to the Workers as env by the stack itself, so `.env.local` cannot override them.

`isDevServer` (`ALCHEMY_DEV=true`, set by `alchemy dev`) is what switches the stack into this
shape, and `MAPLE_DEV_APPS` narrows it to the requested apps. Neither is stage-derived: a dev
_stage_ can still be deployed to the cloud, and a deploy is never partial.

What this buys over the old per-app `wrangler dev` under turbo + portless:

- **One definition.** Bindings, crons and exported classes come from `alchemy.run.ts`, for
  dev and deploy alike. There are no `wrangler.jsonc` files any more; the crons/DO/KV/
  rate-limiter mirroring that used to drift between the two is gone with them. `wrangler`
  survives only as an `apps/api` devDependency for `bench:startup-cpu`, whose `worker` mode
  writes a throwaway config for `wrangler check startup`.
- **One process tree.** No turbo fan-out, no per-app `portless` wrapper, no `dev:app`
  indirection: `bun dev` is the stack, and Ctrl-C stops all of it.
- **Crons fire on their real schedule.** `alchemy dev` runs each Worker's declared crons
  itself, and `/cdn-cgi/handler/scheduled` triggers one on demand (Miniflare's path, always
  on — no `--test-scheduled` flag).
- **Almost everything is emulated locally.** Workers, KV, R2, Hyperdrive, queues + consumers,
  Durable Objects, Workflows, rate limiters and `send_email` (written as `.eml` files under
  `.alchemy/local/email/`) all come up `(local)`; storage lives under `.alchemy/local/`.
  The AI Gateway is the one resource still created live in the account.

Gotchas worth knowing:

- **The dev Hyperdrive origin must set `sslmode: "disable"`.** Alchemy defaults a local
  origin to `sslmode=prefer` (`Cloudflare/Hyperdrive/ConnectBinding.ts`), the driver then
  attempts TLS against the docker Postgres, which has SSL off, and every DB call 503s with
  `CONNECT_TIMEOUT` after the dial budget. See `ManagedMapleDb`.
- **`MAPLE_OTEL_INGEST_KEY` is optional on dev stages only** (`selfObservabilityEnv`). The
  local stack resolves the same env contract as a deploy, and no developer has a real
  ingest key; without the exemption the whole stack refuses to start over a key whose only
  job is exporting the Worker's own telemetry.
- Dev stacks run with `ALCHEMY_LOCAL_STATE=1`, so they never touch the account state store.
- `--env-file .env.local` is read once at start: a changed variable needs a restart.
- The children's logs share one terminal. There are no per-app panes as under turbo's TUI.
- A harness that cannot resolve `*.localhost` (the browser-verification preview) uses the
  sticky raw ports `bun dev` prints; `Portless.Route`'s `port` prop pins one outright.
- Ctrl-C stops the whole tree: the shim runs alchemy in its own process group and forwards
  the signal to the group, because alchemy's CLI is several node processes deep and a signal
  to any one of them stops nothing. The routes come off as alchemy tears the session down.
- If portless is not installed or its proxy is down, a route logs a warning and the app is
  reachable on `127.0.0.1:<port>` only; the inter-app URLs still name the `*.localhost`
  hosts, so start the proxy (`portless proxy start`) rather than work around it.

## Single-module Workers

A Worker is one module, `apps/<app>/src/worker.ts`: the alchemy Worker class the root stack
yields (`export default class Alerting extends Cloudflare.Worker<Alerting>()("alerting",
props, impl) {}`) and the bundle alchemy builds (`main: import.meta.url`). `props` is an
Effect that reads `MapleStack` (`@maple/infra/cloudflare`, provided once by the root from
`Alchemy.Stage`) and yields whatever other resources the Worker binds — its `Command.Build`,
the shared `ManagedMapleDb` or `WorkersObservabilityDestinations` (alchemy registers a
resource by id, so a second module yielding the same one gets the first's). `impl` runs once
per isolate on the first event and returns the handlers. No hand-written `export default
{ fetch }`, no per-app `alchemy.run.ts`, no factory arguments. Every Worker ships this way.
A Worker that binds another (web's `API` service binding to the api) takes it as a service
the root provides after yielding it (`ApiWorker` in `@maple/infra/cloudflare`) — a
`Worker.ref` reads stored state and cannot see a sibling the same deploy creates.

What each kind of Worker keeps beside the module:

- **Crons** (`alerting`, `api`): `Cloudflare.Workers.cron(expression, handler)` in `impl`,
  under `CronEventSourceLive`, attaches the schedule at plan time and the listener at runtime.
  The source reports every fire as successful, so the platform's retry never engages — and
  nothing is lost: the ticks already log and swallow their own failures, the schedules
  re-fire, and the shell logs a failure outside a tick. The ticks live in `src/scheduled.ts`
  behind a dynamic import, so the api layer graph is off the startup path and out of the
  deploy process (where `impl` also runs), and the test imports it without a runtime. A
  cron fire is an event like any other: the bridge builds the telemetry into its scope and
  flushes after it, so the tick graph carries no tracer or logger of its own (one there
  would shadow the bridge's — `worker-telemetry.test.ts` pins that a tick's spans export).
- **Queues** (`api`): `Cloudflare.Queues.consumeQueueMessages(queue, settings, handler)` in
  `impl`, under `Queues.EventSourceLive`, yields the `Consumer` resource at plan time and the
  listener at runtime. The consumers carry `renamedFrom({ fqn })` with the ids the retired api
  factory declared them under (`vcs-sync-consumer`, …): alchemy migrates the state rows, so
  the deploy plans a noop instead of re-creating each consumer — and the delete of the old
  row would otherwise have removed the physical consumer the new row had adopted. Drop the
  decoration once every stage has deployed past it. The init reads the queues back off the
  host's props at plan time (`boundQueues`) rather than declaring them a second time: a
  second declaration replaces the first's registration, props included.
- **Background telemetry** (`api`): queue batches and cron ticks run under their own SDK
  instance (`eventTelemetry` in `@maple/infra/worker-telemetry`, provided around the event)
  so `maple-vcs-sync`, `maple-planetscale-webhooks` and `maple-slack-reconcile` keep their
  own service names — background work sharing `maple-api` skewed its p99 to 32s
  (2026-09-04). The layer graphs those events build carry no tracer or logger of their own.
- **Durable Object and Workflows** (`api`): alchemy's Effect-native forms, yielded from the init.
  `ChatSessionObject` (`src/chat/ChatSession.ts`) is `Cloudflare.DurableObject<Self>()("ChatSession",
impl)` over the plain `ChatSession` class — the outer Effect resolves state and env (it also runs
  at plan time against a mock state, so it must not touch storage), the inner one builds the
  session and returns its methods as Effects, which alchemy's bridge runs per RPC call and hands
  back as-is. `ClickHouseSchemaApplyWorkflow` and `InvestigationFanoutWorkflow`
  (`src/workflows/*.ts`) are `Cloudflare.Workflow<Self>()(name, impl)` in the documented shape: the
  init resolves what the run needs (the fan-out yields `ChatSessionObject` for typed stubs), then
  returns an `Effect.fn` body. The bodies (`*.run.ts`) are Effects on alchemy's step API —
  `durableStep` (`src/workflows/durable-step.ts`) is `Cloudflare.Workflows.task` over an Effect
  whose failure rejects the step, so Cloudflare retries it per config — reading `Database`,
  `Cloudflare.WorkerEnvironment` and `Cloudflare.WorkflowStep` as services. The class wraps a run
  in `withPgConnectionScope` + `layerPg` (one Postgres connection per run) and the run's own
  `eventTelemetry` (`maple-schema-apply`, `maple-investigations`), which flushes when alchemy
  closes the run's scope. Everything is imported statically: the Worker evaluates in ~80 ms of
  the 1 s startup-CPU budget on alchemy's bundle (`scripts/bench-startup-cpu.ts`, 2026-09-07).
  The yield is the whole declaration: the binding (named after the class — `ChatSession`,
  `ClickHouseSchemaApplyWorkflow`, `InvestigationFanoutWorkflow`, which is what the services read
  off the env), the namespace, the physical workflow (`<worker>-<class>-<hash>`, alchemy's
  `makeWorkflowName`) and the generated entry's class export. No reference-form bindings, no
  hand-written entry.
- **Assets** (`landing`, `local-ui`): the handler reads `Cloudflare.Workers.Request` and
  `env.ASSETS` and hands the web `Response` back through `HttpServerResponse.fromWeb`.
  landing's negotiation is a plain function in `src/handler.ts` for the same test reason.
- **The application database** (`alerting`, `api`): `yield* MapleDb(consumer)` in the init
  binds `MAPLE_DB` in the stage's flavor — `Hyperdrive.Connect(ManagedMapleDb)` on dev
  stages, `host.bind` of the dashboard-managed config by id on stg/prd (alchemy has no `env`
  form for a Hyperdrive it did not create; its own `ConnectBinding` attaches the same raw
  metadata), nothing on previews. The api's Workflows yield it too, from their outer phase.
  The root yields `ManagedMapleDb` first on dev stages so its `MAPLE_PG_URL` read happens
  outside any init, where alchemy's plan-time ConfigProvider would bind it as a secret. Every
  Postgres layer reads the `MapleDbConnection` port (`apps/api/src/platform/bindings.ts`),
  never the env.

Still a factory: `web` (takes `api`, for the service binding); `ingest` and `electric` are
ECS services. `web` follows once its props can `yield* MapleApi`; until then its
`src/worker.ts` is a plain `export default { fetch }` with no telemetry, because
`Telemetry.layer` only reaches handlers the bridge runs.

Alchemy evaluates that module in three places — the deploy process, `alchemy dev`, and the
deployed isolate — and two rules keep it honest about which one it is in:

- **Props are a plan-time Effect, guarded for the bundle.** The stage-derived props (`name`,
  `domain`, `env`, the portless `dev` block) read `MapleStack` (`@maple/infra/cloudflare`), a
  service the root stack provides once from `Alchemy.Stage`, so the module never imports
  portless or parses the stage itself. Alchemy also evaluates props inside the deployed
  bundle, where they are inert, so the props Effect returns early under
  `globalThis.__ALCHEMY_RUNTIME__` — alchemy's bundler folds it to `true`, and the stack-side
  branch plus the `@maple/infra` modules only it reaches are dead-code-eliminated. Check by
  grepping the bundle under `.alchemy/bundles/electric-sync/` for a `maple.dev` hostname.
- **The app layer is built on the first request, not in init.** `impl` (init) also runs at
  plan time, and alchemy's plan-time ConfigProvider auto-binds every `Config` it sees read
  during init onto the Worker as a secret — which would override the explicit `env` contract
  (a PR preview deliberately gets no `ELECTRIC_URL`). So the route graph is dynamic-imported
  and built once per isolate on the first `fetch` (`Effect.cached`), against a scope that is
  never closed: workerd has no isolate teardown, so nothing in the layer may need releasing.
- **The bridge serves the router and owns telemetry.** `fetch` is the `HttpRouter.toHttpEffect`
  handler as-is: the bridge renders its typed failures before its tracer runs (`RouteNotFound`
  → an Ok span with a 404; a defect → a 500, which the SDK records as an Error server span per
  OTEL semconv), so no `orDie` sits on the request path — the one that did turned every 404
  into an Error span. `apps/electric-sync/src/worker-bridge.test.ts` drives the real bridge
  path and pins all three outcomes; `apps/api/src/worker-bridge.test.ts` does the same for the
  api's liveness, preflight and graph-failure fast paths. Telemetry is one line on init,
  `Effect.provide(WorkerTelemetry({ serviceName }))` from `@maple/infra/worker-telemetry`, on
  the Workers that do work (api, electric-sync, alerting). The asset Workers (landing, local-ui)
  deliberately have none: a server span per static page view is ingest volume spent
  observing a file read, and it would put the internal ingest key in a marketing site's env
  for it. Workers Observability covers their logs. It is the
  published `Maple.Telemetry` from `@maple-dev/alchemy/telemetry` (Maple's counterpart of
  alchemy's `Axiom.Telemetry` sugar) with Maple's own defaults. It registers the SDK's
  `requestLayer` with alchemy's `Telemetry.layer`, which builds it into each request scope
  and flushes after the response — no hand-rolled tracer, `waitUntil`, or flush shim. The
  key/endpoint bindings `Maple.Telemetry` can do stay off for our Workers:
  `selfObservabilityEnv(stage)` owns those, with the PR-preview rules.

What it costs: the root stack imports the worker module, so the Alchemy-entrypoints
typecheck (`tsconfig.alchemy.json`) covers electric-sync's runtime graph and needs
`@maple-dev/effect-sdk` built first and `@maple/electric-sync` installed in the quality
shard (`ci.yml`). Measured on the pilot (#745, local workerd A/B): +15ms startup CPU
(41→56ms, budget ~1s), ~+8ms cold first request, ~+0.2ms/request warm.

### The api Worker's layout (2026-09-07)

`apps/api/src/worker.ts` is the composition root only — props plus an init that reads as a
list of yields. What it composes lives beside it:

- `src/resources/*` — one file per resource the Worker binds, declared at module scope and
  inert until yielded (`queues.ts`, `replay-blobs.ts`, `env.ts` for the
  `Config` catalog). Stage-derived physical names come from `stageNamed` / `stageProps`
  (`@maple/infra/cloudflare`), which read alchemy's own `Stage` — one of the platform
  services a Worker's init may require, unlike `MapleStack` — behind the same
  `__ALCHEMY_RUNTIME__` guard as a Worker's props, because alchemy evaluates a resource's props
  Effect wherever it is yielded, the bundle included. The ingest factory yields the same
  `ReplayBlobs` declaration to mint the gateway's writer token.
- `src/worker/*` — the runtime shell: `http.ts` (the lazily built route graph and `fetch`),
  `rpc.ts`, `crons.ts`, `consumers.ts` (`consumeQueueMessages` over the declarations, so no
  binding is read back off the host), `events.ts`, `modules.ts` (the dynamic imports), and
  `bindings.ts`.
- **Bindings are alchemy capabilities, read as Maple ports.** The init yields
  `Queues.WriteQueue(VcsSyncQueue)`, `R2.ReadBucket(ReplayBlobs)` and the four `Cloudflare.RateLimit(...)`s
  (`worker/bindings.ts`); each yield attaches the native binding at plan time — under the
  resource's logical id, so the queue and bucket bindings are `vcs-sync`, `replay-blobs`, … —
  and resolves it from the env in the isolate. The clients become the ports in
  `platform/bindings.ts` (`VcsSyncQueueProducer`, `ApiV2RateLimit`, `ReplayBlobBucket`,
  `McpSessionStore`, …), which is what the services depend on: no service reads a binding off
  `WorkerEnvironment` by name any more, tests provide fakes, and a host without the binding
  (alerting, the CLI) provides nothing — the services that can degrade read the port through
  `Effect.serviceOption`. The clients' methods are colored with alchemy's `RuntimeContext`, a
  phantom that keeps them out of the init phase; the ports discharge it with
  `RuntimeContext.phantom`, as alchemy's own runtime helpers do.
- What stays on `env:`: `AI` (the Gateway resource, read by name by the LLM shim), the stage
  partition the rate limiters key under, and `EMAIL` on prd — alchemy's capabilities have no
  "bound on some stages" form, and the plan/runtime split makes a conditional yield lie on
  one side. `MAPLE_DB` is bound from the init (`MapleDb`, above).
- The Worker env reaches a graph once, through the ports (`workerEnvLayer(env)` in
  `apiPorts`): the runtime modules (`vcs-sync-runtime.ts`, …) declare `WorkerEnvironment`
  and `ConfigProvider` as requirements and wire neither; a Durable Object or a Workflow run
  hands its own env record to the same helper.

## The retired AWS opt-in flag (`MAPLE_DEPLOY_AWS_INGEST`)

The Rust OTLP gateway (`apps/ingest`) moved from Railway to ECS Fargate. While the
cut-over was in flight, `MAPLE_DEPLOY_AWS_INGEST=1` gated both `AWS.providers()` and the
ingest resources, so an unset variable produced a byte-identical pure-Cloudflare stack.

**The flag is gone (2026-08).** ECS is the only ingest path now, so the gate had nothing
left to protect: `AWS.providers()` is registered unconditionally (it cannot be
stage-derived — the `Alchemy.Stack` options are evaluated before `Alchemy.Stage` is
readable inside the stack effect), and `stageDeploysIngest` alone decides which stages get
a fleet. It covers prd, stg **and PR previews**; dev stages run the gateway through
docker-compose. The spend gate moved to where the spend is: a preview only exists while
its PR carries the `preview` label.

Do not reintroduce a global on/off env flag for this. If a stage should not have a fleet,
say so in `stageDeploysIngest`, where it is typed, unit-tested and visible in review.

**The #378 hang.** The flag was _also_ introduced because turning the AWS half on wedged
every production deploy with no log line and no network I/O. The cause was alchemy's
env-credential path (`CI=true`): it discovered the account with an STS `GetCallerIdentity`
issued while its own `AWSEnvironment` was still being constructed, and that call waited on
the half-built environment for its endpoint resolver — a self-deadlock. Supplying
`AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` skips the lookup. Reproduced locally with `CI=true` and the id unset, on
alchemy 2.0.0-beta.64 through beta.74. The deploy workflows now set it — **every workflow
that deploys the stack must**, including `deploy-pr-preview.yml`.

**Why the binary is compiled outside the image build.** Alchemy's docker build passes no
`--cache-from`, and a fresh runner's layer cache is empty, so a Dockerfile that runs
`cargo build` recompiles all 385 crates on every deploy however the layers are arranged.
Cold cost is **2m54s, measured** — an earlier version of this note guessed ~20 minutes,
which was wrong by ~7x and had already been quoted back as fact in a code review, so treat
the number as load-bearing. The workflow compiles inside `rust:1.94-bookworm` rather than
on the runner because the runtime base is `debian:bookworm-slim` (glibc 2.36) while
`ubuntu-24.04` ships 2.39 — a host-built binary dies with `version 'GLIBC_2.39' not found`.

## Hyperdrive: why api and alerting have separate configs

Measured over 6h on prd: `alerting` issued 60,688 Postgres queries/hour against the api's
1,415 — 97% versus 2%. Sharing one Hyperdrive config meant sharing one origin connection
pool, and the api spent its time queueing behind the alerting crons. A dial that found a
free slot took 12ms; one that did not stalled until Hyperdrive's 15s connection timeout,
which is what put `maple-api`'s p99 at 15.4s.

The two configs **partition** the origin's connections rather than creating more: the
per-config `origin_connection_limit`s sum against the branch's `max_connections`, and
Hyperdrive will not coordinate between them, so over-provisioning one starves the other at
the database rather than at the pool.

**Open item — staging points at production.** `resolveHyperdriveRefId` returns the prd
config for `stg` (owner decision, 2026-07-14). stg workers therefore read and write the
production database, and the stg alerting crons overlap prod's. `MAPLE_ALERTING_ALLOW_NONPROD`
exists to keep those crons off for exactly this reason. Fixing it means a PlanetScale `stg`
branch plus dedicated `maple-stg` / `maple-alerting-stg` dashboard configs, split per
consumer the same way prd is — and then a deliberate decision about whether stg crons
should run.

## The cold-start regression (`strictExecutionOrder: false`)

alchemy ≥ beta.70 sets rolldown `strictExecutionOrder: true`, which wraps ~every chunk in a
lazy `__esmMin` initializer. The DB module graph (drizzle `pgTable` schemas + Effect Schema
ASTs) then evaluates on first use — inside the first Postgres call of each fresh isolate —
instead of at script startup. That stepped the cold dial from ~2s to ~9-11s on 2026-08-08
(deploy 2679ba80) and produced the CONNECT_TIMEOUT incident; see the 2026-08-11
investigation.

The override in `apps/api/src/worker.ts` moves that cost back to script startup, off the
request path. If chunking ever regresses into upstream #749 (`ScriptStartupError: Cannot
access '<minified>' before initialization`), the deploy fails loudly at upload — remove the
override and warm the DB graph off the request path instead.

## Alchemy v1 → v2 notes

The stack was written against alchemy v1 and migrated to v2. Equivalences worth knowing
when reading old code or docs:

- **`HyperdriveRef` has no v2 equivalent.** Binding a dashboard-managed config by ID is
  done by attaching raw `{ type: "hyperdrive", name, id }` binding metadata from the Worker's
  init (`host.bind` inside `MapleDb`, `cloudflare/maple-db.ts`) — the same mechanism the env
  binder uses. No cloud
  resource is created and the origin credentials stay in the dashboard.
- **`Ai()` became an AI Gateway resource.** v2 emits the `{ type: "ai" }` binding by
  attaching `Cloudflare.AI.Gateway`, which also fronts model calls with caching,
  rate-limits and logging. The deploy token needs account-level "AI Gateway: Edit".
- **`eventSources` became `Queues.Consumer`.** The consumer is a sibling resource pointing
  at the worker by `scriptName`.
- **Resource attributes are lazy Outputs.** `worker.url` and friends cannot be
  string-interpolated at plan time. This is why every deployed stage gets custom domains
  (`resolveMapleDomains`) and why inter-app URLs are plain strings chosen by the stack
  rather than read off resources.
- **DO classes are SQLite-backed by default** in v2.
- **The vendored runtime lib is gone.** `lib/effect-cloudflare` was a hand-copied subset of
  `alchemy-effect`'s `Cloudflare/Workers/*`, from before that package shipped; ~1600 of its
  2520 lines had no consumer at all (the DO/Workflow/RPC/KV/fetcher/websocket cluster —
  apps/api's own DO and Workflows extend `cloudflare:workers` directly). It was deleted; the
  ~250 lines with consumers live in `packages/infra` behind runtime-only subpaths
  (`/worker-runtime`, `/workers-cache`, `/r2`, `/config-helpers`).
- **Alchemy's runtime services were not importable from a hand-written Worker entry**
  (its exports map has no entry finer than a directory, and the `Cloudflare/Workers` barrel
  drags `fdir`, rolldown glue and `node:module` into a bundle — 426 KB against 14 KB for the
  tag alone). That is why `packages/infra` carried its own `WorkerEnvironment` and R2
  client. With api and alerting on the class form (2026-09-07) the Workers use alchemy's
  binding capabilities directly (`Queues.WriteQueue`, `KV.ReadWriteNamespace`,
  `R2.ReadBucket`, `RateLimit`, `Hyperdrive.Connect`), the R2 client is gone, and the
  `WorkerEnvironment` tag stays only for its stricter type — alchemy's is
  `Record<string, any>` — under alchemy's exact key, so both resolve to the same service.

## Cost decisions

These are cash-flow calls, not design ones, and should be revisited rather than treated as
architecture:

- **No NAT gateway** in the ingest VPC. NAT bills $0.045/GB _processed_ on top of egress,
  and the gateway exists to push gzipped telemetry outbound — at current volume NAT alone
  would cost more than the compute and the egress combined, and it scales linearly with
  growth. Tasks therefore carry public IPs, which is why the security-group split between
  the ALB and the tasks is load-bearing rather than tidy. The S3 gateway endpoint keeps ECR
  image pulls off the public path and is free.
- **Same-region Tinybird.** AWS bills $0.09/GB to the public internet but $0.01/GB to a
  public IP in the same region, and export traffic dwarfs every other line item — at 200k
  req/s that is ~$83k/mo vs ~$16k/mo. A workspace on `https://api.tinybird.co` is GCP
  Frankfurt, where NO AWS region colocates and the move costs more than Railway did.
  Verify `TINYBIRD_HOST` before changing `resolveAwsRegion`.
- **The OTel collector is prd-only** (`stageDeploysCollector`). The intent is every stage
  that deploys the gateway, at ~$13.5/mo per stage at the non-prd size. Adding the
  `preview:collector` label to a PR sets `MAPLE_DEPLOY_AWS_COLLECTOR=1` for that preview,
  which is how it was verified on Fargate before it reached prod.
- **PR previews get an ingest fleet, but no database.** PlanetScale PR branches billed
  continuously and consumed the account's Hyperdrive config cap, so `resolveDatabaseMode`
  returns `"none"` for `pr`: DB-backed routes 500 and the rest of the preview works. The
  reverse path is documented on that function. The AWS half _is_ deployed — a preview gets
  its own VPC + ALB + ECS fleet, which is real money, so it only runs while the PR carries
  the `preview` label and is destroyed the moment the label comes off or the PR closes.
  A preview has no ingest domain, so its ALB answers plain HTTP on 80 with no ACM
  certificate; the URL is posted on the PR comment. There is no longer a separate
  on-demand ingest preview stack (`scripts/ingest-preview.run.ts` and
  `deploy-pr-ingest.yml` are deleted) — two alchemy stacks claiming the same
  `maple-ingest-pr-<n>` physical names is how orphan fleets accumulate.
- **x86_64, not Graviton.** Flipping `cpuArchitecture` to `"ARM64"` is the whole switch
  (~20% cheaper) but needs an ARM builder: cross-compiling Rust under QEMU is 10-30 min a
  build, for single-digit dollars a month at this size. Revisit with an ARM runner.

## Things that have broken a deploy before

Short list; each has a comment at the site.

- A **relative `dockerfile`** path. Alchemy has flipped how it resolves one between
  releases — `ECR.Image` joins it onto `context`, the ECS image source (beta.73+) resolves
  it against the cwd — and each flip broke the deploy. Absolute paths pass through both.
- **`listenerPort` vs `port`** on `ECS.Service`. `port` is the container port; the listener
  defaults to 443 once `certificateArn` is set. Setting `listenerPort: INGEST_PORT` puts
  the listener on 3474, which Cloudflare's proxy does not forward to, _and_ drops `port`
  back to alchemy's default 3000 while the gateway binds 3474 — so no target ever passes
  `/health`.
- **A security group that does not admit the listener port.** A stage without an ingest
  domain gets an HTTP listener on 80, not 443. The first preview deploy came up healthy and
  timed out on every request for exactly this reason.
- **An arm64 image on an X86_64 task** — fails at start with "image Manifest does not
  contain descriptor matching platform 'linux/amd64'". Hence the explicit
  `runtimePlatform`.
- **A cargo `--target-dir` inside the image context.** Alchemy hashes the context with
  `hashDirectory`, which has no `.dockerignore` support and derives exclusions from
  gitignore rules _without_ rebasing root-anchored ones onto the context dir —
  `/apps/ingest/target` becomes the glob `apps/ingest/target/**` evaluated with
  `cwd=apps/ingest`, matching nothing. The whole target dir would be walked and hashed on
  every deploy.
- **A first deploy of a new stage with the AWS half on** used to fail: each service's ACM
  certificate landed `PENDING_VALIDATION` and its 443 listener refused it, and the
  workflows recovered by publishing the validation CNAMEs with a script and deploying
  again. `@maple/infra/acm` now does that inside the stack — it resolves the Cloudflare
  zone from the certificate's own hostname, publishes the CNAME ACM asks for, and blocks
  the listener on `ISSUED` — so a new certificate-bearing service needs no registration
  anywhere and no second pass. The remaining manual record is the **proxied CNAME at the
  ALB** for each public service, which the deploy output names.
