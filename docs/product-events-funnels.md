# Product events + funnels — plan

Status: **implemented in code (2026-08-17), pending rollout.** Goal: answer "referral → signed
up → started a plan" for any org (and for Maple itself), from browser, mobile and backend events,
as a real funnel in the product rather than a hand-written `run_sql`.

## Rollout checklist (operator steps the code cannot do)

1. **Tinybird**: `bun run --cwd apps/api tinybird:deploy` creates `product_events`,
   `identity_links` and their MVs. Then populate both from their sources with an explicit `tb`
   step (the SDK has no populate option — same caveat as 0014). Until populated, page views
   read as zero on managed orgs. Old `web_events`/`web_events_mv` can be removed from the
   workspace afterwards.
2. **BYO ClickHouse**: migration 0021 bumps `clickHouseSchemaVersion` to 21 (`requiredForIngest`
   default), so BYO orgs' ingest routing is un-ready until they apply schema. Deliberate — the
   gateway now writes the new `session_events` columns and `product_events` directly.
3. **Secrets** (api worker): `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `AUTUMN_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (both routes answer
   503 until set); optional `MAPLE_PRODUCT_EVENTS_INGEST_KEY` (defaults to `MAPLE_INGEST_KEY`).
   Register `POST /webhooks/clerk` (event `user.created`) in Clerk and `POST /webhooks/autumn`
   (`billing.updated`) in Autumn.
4. **Ingest**: `INGEST_TINYBIRD_DATASOURCE_PRODUCT_EVENTS` defaults to `product_events`; nothing
   to set unless the datasource name differs.
5. Publish `@maple-dev/effect-sdk` / `@maple-dev/browser` so customers' events start carrying
   identity; older builds keep writing (all new columns default).
6. **Billing**: `bun run --cwd apps/api atmn push` (no package script exists; `atmn` is an
   `apps/api` dependency) so the `product_events` feature and its `startup` plan item exist in
   Autumn before the gateway starts reserving against it. Until pushed, Autumn answers
   `allowed: false` for the unknown feature — a real denial, not an error, so `is_allowed`'s
   fail-open does NOT rescue it. Neither event path rejects on `product_events` for exactly that
   reason: usage is recorded fail-open and nothing is dropped — just unbilled.

### Billing

Product events are their own metered Autumn feature, `product_events` (unit = one event),
separate from `browser_sessions`. The ingest gateway meters it on two paths, both with the same
reserve → WAL enqueue → confirm/release shape as session starts (`metered_enqueue` in
`apps/ingest/src/main.rs`): (1) `POST /v1/events` reserves the number of rows that survived
`sanitize_product_event`; (2) `POST /v1/sessionEvents` reserves the number of `type == "custom"`
rows in the batch (a browser `track()` call is the same unit as a server-side event) and keeps its
entitlement REJECTION on `browser_sessions`. **Neither path rejects on `product_events`**: an
exhausted (or un-provisioned) product-events allowance bills usage-based overage instead of 402-ing
a whole session transcript or a backend's buffered batch. Automatic session events (clicks, navigations, ...) stay unmetered. **Beta pricing
(2026-08-17): the `startup` item is `unlimited: true` with no price** — usage is tracked in Autumn
(and shown on the billing page as "Unlimited · free during beta") so real volumes are known before
a price is set. To start charging, swap `unlimited` for an `included` allowance + `price` in
`apps/api/autumn.config.ts` (the commented example is $0.05 per 1,000 events past 1M/month) and
push. `DailySpendService` emits `DailyVolume.productEvents` from `product_events`
(`Kind != 'navigation'`, matching what the gateway meters).

## Where we are

Verified against production on 2026-08-17:

- `web_events` (`packages/domain/src/tinybird/datasources.ts`, `packages/query-engine/src/ch/tables.ts`)
  already exists as "the funnel substrate": time-sorted `$pageview` + `track()` rows, `EventName`
  as the step key, `Seq` tiebreak, `idx_event_name` skip index. **Nothing queries it as a funnel** —
  no `windowFunnel`/`sequenceMatch` anywhere in the repo; the `funnel` widget is a name/value bar.
- Referral (`Referrer`, `ReferrerHost`, `Utm*`), `VisitorId`, `UserId`, `GroupId` live only on
  `session_replays`. `web_events` carries `SessionId` only, so any cross-session question is a join.
- The cross-site visitor cookie works: `maple.dev` (`@maple-dev/browser`) and `app.maple.dev`
  (effect-sdk client) share `VisitorId` and land in the same org. 4 weeks: 3,462 landing visitors →
  1,979 referred → 94 reached the app → 48 identified → 22 referred + identified.
- ~⅓ of `maple-web` sessions have empty `VisitorId`/`Host` (pre-0011 SDK builds, GPC); they drop
  out of any visitor-keyed funnel.
- No `signup_completed` and no `plan_started` event exists. Plan start cannot come from the browser:
  `attach` returns a Stripe `paymentUrl` and the tab leaves; the plan starts on the Stripe → Autumn
  side. There is no server-side `track()` and no Clerk/Autumn/Stripe webhook route in `apps/api`.
- 30-day TTL on `session_replays` / `session_events` / `web_events`; `web_events` is MV-only and
  cannot be rebuilt past its source's horizon.

Today the referral → identified step is answerable with raw SQL; plan-start is not answerable at all.

## Target model

### 1. `product_events` (rename of `web_events`, widened)

`web_events` is renamed because the table stops being web-only: browser rows still arrive via the
`session_events` MV, but backend and mobile events are **direct-ingested** into the same table.

```
product_events
  OrgId        LowCardinality(String)
  Timestamp    DateTime64(9)
  Seq          UInt32                -- browser: session_events.Seq; direct: 0
  Source       LowCardinality(String) DEFAULT 'browser'   -- browser | server | mobile
  SessionId    String DEFAULT ''     -- '' for server events
  VisitorId    String DEFAULT ''     -- device/anonymous id (browser cookie, mobile install id)
  UserId       String DEFAULT ''
  GroupId      String DEFAULT ''
  Kind         LowCardinality(String)  -- navigation | custom | screen (mobile)
  EventName    String                -- '$pageview' / '$screen' / track() name
  Host         LowCardinality(String) DEFAULT ''
  PagePath     String DEFAULT ''
  Url          String DEFAULT ''
  ServiceName  LowCardinality(String) DEFAULT ''   -- which SDK/service emitted it
  Attributes   Map(String, String)
ENGINE MergeTree
PARTITION BY toDate(Timestamp)
ORDER BY (OrgId, Timestamp, VisitorId, SessionId, Seq)   -- see note
TTL toDate(Timestamp) + INTERVAL 180 DAY
INDEX idx_event_name EventName TYPE set(64) GRANULARITY 4
INDEX idx_user_id    UserId    TYPE bloom_filter GRANULARITY 4
```

Decisions baked in:

- **Person key on the row.** The SDK already resolves identity lazily when session rows post and
  spans start (`clerk-auth-bridge.tsx`, `identify()`); session events get the same stamping in
  `packages/browser-session/src/events/events-sink.ts` (`visitor_id`, `user_id`, `group_id` on each
  NDJSON line). The MV copies them through. No MV-side join against `session_replays` — that would
  depend on insert ordering.
    - Requires adding `VisitorId`/`UserId`/`GroupId` (`DEFAULT ''`) to `session_events` too
      (migration + Tinybird forward query, same shape as the 0012 `Attributes` widening).
    - Rows from older SDKs arrive with `''`; the funnel falls back to a `session_replays` lookup for
      those, or simply excludes them — pick "exclude + show coverage" (matches how the analytics page
      already treats sessions without the 0011 block).
- **Sorting key**: `Timestamp` second so time ranges are a primary-index scan (the reason
  `web_events` exists), then `VisitorId` so a per-person `windowFunnel` groups over contiguous rows.
  Keep `SessionId`/`Seq` for stable step order.
- **Retention 180d**, not 30. Table is tiny (13 distinct event names, thousands of rows/month in
  the dogfood org). A referral→paid funnel spans weeks; 30d loses the tail. Browser rows can never
  be rebuilt past 30d (source TTL) — accepted; direct-ingested rows have no source and are the
  primary copy. `retention-matrix.test.ts` pins this; update it deliberately.
- **`Source` column** so a re-run of the browser backfill can `DELETE WHERE Source = 'browser'`
  instead of `TRUNCATE` (which would destroy direct-ingested rows). This replaces the
  "drop view → truncate → backfill → create view" one-writer invariant from migration 0014.
- Name: `product_events`. Not `events` (ambiguous next to `session_events`/`error_events`), not
  `analytics_events` (the page is called Web Analytics; that name will age the same way).

### 2. Direct ingest — `POST /v1/events`

Ingest gateway (`apps/ingest/src/main.rs`), NDJSON like `/v1/sessionEvents`, authenticated by
ingest key (org from the key, never the body). Body per line:

```json
{
	"timestamp": "...",
	"name": "plan_started",
	"source": "server",
	"user_id": "user_…",
	"group_id": "org_…",
	"visitor_id": "",
	"session_id": "",
	"service_name": "maple-api",
	"attributes": { "plan": "startup" }
}
```

- Same caps as `sanitize_session_event` (name 128, ≤32 props, key 64, value 1024, 8 KiB total).
  Reject `name` starting with `$` from direct ingest (reserved for `$pageview`/`$screen`).
- `Kind = 'custom'` unless `name = '$screen'` (mobile screen views → `Kind='screen'`).
- New `TelemetrySignal::ProductEvents`, `INGEST_TINYBIRD_DATASOURCE_PRODUCT_EVENTS`, entry in
  `clickhouse_insert_mappings.rs`, entitlement check + per-row metering against the new
  `product_events` feature (see "Billing" above).
- Writes go where session events go today (Tinybird managed; BYO CH via the export lane).
- Mobile: no SDK in scope. The endpoint _is_ the contract; a mobile app posts with a persistent
  install id as `visitor_id` and `identify`-equivalent `user_id`. `@maple-dev/effect-sdk` server side
  gets `track()` (`packages/effect-sdk/src/server`?) as a thin client of this endpoint so Node/Bun
  backends have the same call as the browser.

### 3. Server-side emitters for Maple's own funnel

`apps/api`:

- `ProductEventsService.track({ userId, groupId, name, attributes })` — Effect service, posts to
  the ingest gateway with Maple's own dogfood ingest key (same org that `maple-web`/`maple-landing`
  report into). `Schema.TaggedError` for the failure; never fails the caller (fire-and-forget on a
  forked fiber, `root: true` — see the ambient-span footgun).
- **`signup_completed`**: Clerk webhook `user.created` (Svix-signed) → new route
  `apps/api/src/routes/webhooks/clerk.http.ts`. `user_id` from the payload; `visitor_id` unknown
  server-side — stitching to the marketing visit happens via identity (below), not on this row.
  Fallback/complement: `apps/web` fires `signup_completed` client-side on the first
  `/quick-start` landing after Clerk `createdAt` is within N minutes; keep the webhook as truth.
- **`plan_started`**: webhook from the billing side (Autumn if it offers one for
  attach/subscription-created; else Stripe `checkout.session.completed` +
  `customer.subscription.created`, keyed back to the org via the Autumn customer id). Also emit
  synchronously in the `attach` inline-success branch (no `paymentUrl`) for the no-redirect case;
  dedup by `attributes.subscription_id`.
- Same route family later carries `plan_changed`, `plan_cancelled`.

### 4. Identity stitching

The person key for a funnel step is `if(UserId != '', UserId, VisitorId)`. Anonymous marketing
visits (VisitorId only) and server events (UserId only) meet through **`identity_links`**: an
MV over `session_replays` (and later mobile identify calls) emitting `(OrgId, VisitorId, UserId,
FirstSeen)` — ReplacingMergeTree keyed `(OrgId, VisitorId, UserId)`. The funnel query resolves
each row's person key via a `LEFT JOIN identity_links` (or `dictGet` on BYO CH) so a visitor's
pre-signup rows and their post-signup UserId rows collapse into one person. Cheap: the link table
is one row per (visitor,user) pair.

### 5. Query engine

[`effect-clickhouse`](https://github.com/MapleTechLabs/effect-clickhouse):

- Parametric aggregates `windowFunnel(windowSec, mode?)(ts, cond1..condN)` and
  `sequenceMatch(pattern)(ts, cond…)` following the handwritten `quantile(q)` pattern in
  `src/ch/functions/aggregate.ts:74`. `retention()` optional.

`packages/query-engine/src/ch/queries/product-events.ts` (replaces `web-analytics.ts`'s
`web_events` references; the page-view queries move here unchanged):

- `productEventsFunnelQuery({ steps, keyBy: "person" | "visitor" | "user" | "session",
windowSeconds, filters })` → per-step `count`, `conversion_from_prev`, `conversion_from_first`.
  Step = `{ eventName } | { pagePath, host? } | { referrerHost | utmSource | ... }`. A
  session-dimension step (referral) becomes step 0's condition through the person's first
  `session_replays` row; event steps are `EventName = …` conditions on `product_events`.
- `productEventsFunnelBreakdownQuery` — same, `GROUP BY` one dimension (`UtmSource`,
  `ReferrerHost`, `Country`, `Attributes[k]`).
- `productEventNamesQuery` — the step picker's autocomplete (names + counts, 30d).
- Every query keeps `$.OrgId.eq(param.string("orgId"))`; register in `benchmark/catalog.ts` and add
  parity coverage in the ClickHouse e2e like `web-analytics-parity.clickhouse.e2e.test.ts`
  (seed dates must be now-relative — TTL).
- `apps/api/src/routes/internal/query-engine.http.ts` fallback message and the
  `useWebEvents` switch get renamed (`useProductEvents`), same "absent table → raw
  `session_events`" degrade for page views; funnels **require** the table (no raw fallback —
  server/mobile rows only exist there).

### 6. Surfaces

- **Dashboard widget**: new `funnel` config that is step-based (not group-by). Today's `funnel`
  render shape stays as the renderer; the _widget type_ gains `steps[]`, `keyBy`, `window`.
  `packages/domain/src/http/v2/dashboards.ts` + parity test, `dashboard-schema-doc.ts` for MCP.
- **`/analytics` → Funnels tab** reusing the existing filter sidebar (`WebAnalyticsFilters` become
  `ProductEventsFilters`), plus an event-name breakdown panel.
- **MCP**: `query_funnel` tool (or a `funnel` mode on `query_data`) and `list_product_events`.
- Docs (`apps/landing/src/content/docs/…`): `track()` server-side, `/v1/events`, funnels page.

## Migration / rename sequence

Order matters because `web_events` has no dedup and `session_events` still holds every browser
row for 30d — the rename is a rebuild, not a `RENAME TABLE`.

1. Migration `0021_product_events` (BYO CH) + Tinybird datasource `product_events` + MV
   `product_events_mv` (from `session_events`, with the new columns), backfill spec from
   `session_events` for the last 30d (same row-wise projection idea as 0014, `Source='browser'`).
   Also `0021` adds `VisitorId/UserId/GroupId` to `session_events` (+ Tinybird forward query).
2. Local CLI: `local-schema-v11.sql`, `local-store-migrations/v10-to-v11-product-events.ts`
   (+ test), bump the schema-version gate.
3. SDKs stamp identity on session events (`browser-session` events-sink; effect-sdk client
   `track.ts`). Backwards compatible — defaults cover old builds.
4. Ingest: `/v1/events`, mappings, signal, env; deploy.
5. Query engine: flip page-view readers `web_events → product_events`; add funnel queries;
   catalog + parity tests; `useWebEvents` rename.
6. Web/MCP surfaces.
7. `apps/api`: `ProductEventsService`, Clerk + billing webhooks, `attach` inline emit.
8. After one full deploy cycle with both tables populated and reads on the new one: migration
   `0017_drop_web_events` (drop MV then table) and remove the Tinybird datasource; delete the
   `web_events` local-schema entries going forward (old versions keep them for the migration chain).

## Open decisions (defaults chosen; flag if you disagree)

- Retention **180d** for `product_events` (could be 365; cost is negligible either way).
- ~~Reuse the browser-sessions entitlement for `/v1/events` rather than a new billable feature.~~
  Superseded 2026-08-17: `product_events` is its own metered feature (see "Billing").
- Person key = `UserId` else `VisitorId`, stitched through `identity_links`; no probabilistic
  matching.
- `signup_completed` truth = Clerk webhook, not the client.
- Mobile SDK is **not** in scope; the HTTP contract is.

## Quick win available before any of this

Referral → identified in app → `onboarding_step_completed` as a `raw_sql_chart` widget over
`session_replays` + `web_events` (the join used for the numbers above). ~15 min, no schema change,
missing only the plan-start step.

## Status: the dashboard funnel widget (2026-08)

The funnel widget's definition is edited as its **query panel** (`FunnelQueryPanel`,
`apps/web/src/components/dashboard-builder/config/funnel-query-panel.tsx`): the panel's source
select offers **Product events** beside Traces / Logs / Metrics (a query-builder source is the
original group-by breakdown drawn as a funnel). The product-events body is the ordered steps —
event steps take a per-step attribute filter (`plan = "pro" AND source = "cli"` →
`attributeEquals`), page steps an optional host — a population where-clause over the session
dimensions (`country = "DE" AND utm.source = "twitter"` → `display.funnel.filters`), and Count by /
Window / Breakdown as add-ons. The definition persists on `display.funnel` and is mirrored flat into
the `product_events_funnel` route params (`ProductEventsFunnelWidgetParams` in `@maple/query-model`),
which the browser server function and the share API's route plan both decode. With a breakdown the
route answers `{ name, value, group }` rows (top 6 groups by step-1 count) and the funnel chart draws
one bar per group per step with a legend.

## Product events from traces — annotate in code (2026-09)

The fourth feed into `product_events`, after browser (`session_events` MV), server and mobile
(`POST /v1/events`). A team marks a span they already emit and it becomes a funnel step that
links back to the request that performed it.

```ts
span.setAttributes({
	"maple.product_event.name": "checkout_completed", // required — presence is the predicate
	"maple.product_event.user_id": user.id, // optional identity
	"maple.product_event.group_id": org.id,
	"maple.product_event.visitor_id": anonId,
	"maple.product_event.url": req.url, // optional page context
})
```

**Every other attribute on the span becomes an event property by default.** Nothing has to be
declared to get started — whatever the team already sets on the span (`plan`, `order.total`, the
full HTTP/DB semconv surface) lands in `Attributes` and is available to funnel breakdowns. The
`maple.product_event.*` control keys are stripped, since they are already promoted to their own
columns.

Two optional controls narrow or replace that default. Both are themselves span attributes: a
materialized view is static SQL per cluster and has no per-org config to read.

```ts
"maple.product_event.include": "plan,seats"   // ONLY these span keys (whitespace trimmed)
"maple.product_event.prop.plan": "pro"        // explicit prop, merged over the base, wins ties
"maple.product_event.include": ""             // and together: full overwrite
```

Three tiers out of one mechanism rather than three modes to pick between:

| `include`      | `prop.*` | `Attributes`                                                       |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| absent         | —        | every span attribute                                               |
| absent         | set      | every span attribute, with the props overriding on a key collision |
| `"plan,seats"` | —        | only `plan` and `seats`                                            |
| `""`           | set      | only the props — the overwrite case                                |

`include` switches on **key presence**, not on a non-empty value, which is what makes the empty
string mean "no span attributes" rather than "no filter". There is no separate replace flag to get
wrong, and `mapUpdate(base, props)` argument order is the override rule — swapped, an override
would be discarded exactly when the key it meant to correct was already present.

Verified against ClickHouse 26.2, all three tiers:

| Scenario                        | Span attributes                                        | Result                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| default                         | `http.method`, `plan=free`, `seats=5`, `prop.plan=pro` | `{http.method, seats, plan:'pro'}` |
| `include: "plan, seats"`        | + `noise`                                              | `{plan:'free', seats:'5'}`         |
| `include: ""` + `prop.plan=pro` | `http.method`, `plan=free`                             | `{plan:'pro'}`                     |

The contract lives in one place — `packages/domain/src/tinybird/product-event-attributes.ts` —
and is read by exactly two consumers that must agree byte for byte: `productEventsTracesMv`
(managed orgs, via `tinybird deploy`) and the frozen copy inside ClickHouse migration 0028 (BYO
clusters). The migration's copy is deliberately NOT imported from the constant: a delta migration
describes one step in history, and a shared constant would silently rewrite what 0028 did the next
time the live projection changes.

### Why an attribute and not a UI action

A product event has to be emitted by the code path that performed the thing, at the moment it
performed it. Marking a trace by hand in the UI marks _one sampled trace_, cannot be replayed over
history, and puts a mutable user-authored row into an append-only fact table. An attribute marks
every trace the path produces, applies retroactively across the whole `traces` retention window,
and is reviewable in the customer's own diff. There is no second store and no write path from the
dashboard — the span is the record, the product event is its projection.

### The link

`product_events` gained `TraceId`/`SpanId` (migration 0028, `DEFAULT ''`, appended, plus a
`bloom_filter` on `TraceId`). Non-empty only on `Source = 'trace'` rows. Real columns rather than
`Attributes` keys because both directions filter on them, and a `Map` lookup on this table reads
the whole map per row — the exact cost `product_events` was split out of `session_events` to avoid.

| Direction                    | Query                           | Surface                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| trace → its product events   | `productEventsForTraceQuery`    | trace detail page, under the anatomy strip       |
| event → the traces behind it | `productEventTraceSamplesQuery` | `/analytics`, when the `eventName` filter is set |

Both are `profile: "list"` with a flat `cache: 60` rather than `timeRangeCache`: they are point
lookups whose answer does not widen with the range asked about, and a completed trace's events
never change at all.

### What it costs

The MV predicate is one `Map` value read per incoming span, on the same block every other `traces`
MV already fires on. An MV sees the insert block, not the table, so `idx_span_attr_keys` does not
help it — this is a real, deliberately small per-span ingest cost.

Copying the whole `SpanAttributes` map **by default** is the deliberate expensive choice. A server
span's map is dominated by HTTP/DB semconv keys, and `product_events` keeps 365 days against raw
`traces`' 30 — so an annotated span's attributes outlive the span itself by a factor of twelve. What
the default buys is that nothing has to be declared to get a useful event; `include` is the lever
for a team that has measured the cost and wants it back, and it is a one-line change on the span
rather than a schema migration.

The practical consequence to watch: attribute pickers over product events list the span's whole
semconv surface for any team that has not set `include`. If that becomes the dominant cost across
orgs rather than for one of them, the lever is a per-org key denylist at the MV — the per-span
`include` handles the single-team case already.

The whole `Attributes` expression only evaluates for rows passing the `WHERE`, i.e. annotated spans,
so its cost is paid per product event rather than per span. The predicate itself stays one map
lookup.

### Rollout

1. **Managed**: `bun run --cwd apps/api tinybird:deploy` creates `product_events_traces_mv` and
   adds the two columns, then an explicit `tb` populate from `traces` (bounded by its 30-day TTL).
   Blocked on the same manual step the rest of this document's checklist is — see
   `project_product_events_tinybird_rollout_pending`.

    **The `FORWARD_QUERY` on `product_events` is what makes this deploy safe, and it is not
    optional.** Adding two defaulted columns is _not_ a free change here: without the forward query
    Tinybird satisfies the new schema by rebuilding the table from the datasources that feed it, and
    both (`session_events`, `traces`) keep 30 days against `product_events`' 365. It says so and
    proceeds anyway —

    > it is going to be backfilled using the following datasources which would lead to a deleting
    > historical data

    — which on this dual-fed table is worse than it sounds: the server and mobile rows arrive by
    `POST /v1/events` and have **no source datasource at all**, so a rebuild drops them at every age,
    not just past 30 days. Verified against a real deploy, not inferred.

    Two traps around it. `DEPLOYMENT_METHOD alter` on `product_events_mv` does **not** substitute —
    tested, and the same data-loss warning returns, because it is the datasource schema change that
    triggers the source backfill, not the view's. And once the forward query is in place Tinybird
    suggests the inverse ("could be applied with ALTER TABLE and no data movement at promotion time
    if you remove the FORWARD*QUERY"); following that suggestion reintroduces the loss. Per the
    Tinybird rules the forward query can be deleted in a \_later* deploy, once this one has compacted.

    **The populate is one-shot and overlap-prone.** Unlike BYO and local, the managed surface has no
    `DELETE WHERE Source = 'trace'` step, so running it twice double-inserts, and running it after
    the MV is already live double-counts every annotated span ingested between MV creation and the
    populate's own snapshot. BYO risks a gap; managed risks duplicates. Same caveat 0014 and 0021
    accepted — but on a table feeding customer-visible funnels, a double-counted conversion is worse
    than a missing one. Populate once, immediately after deploy, and if it fails partway prefer
    deleting the trace rows by hand over re-running it blind.

2. **BYO ClickHouse**: migration 0028, `requiredForIngest: false`. That is safe for one reason
   worth knowing before anyone touches `datasources.ts`: `TraceId`/`SpanId` are declared with **no
   `jsonPath`**, so the insert-mapping generator omits them and the Rust gateway's
   `INSERT INTO product_events (…)` never names them — a cluster stamped below 28 still accepts
   every row it sends. Give those columns a `jsonPath` and the flag becomes a data-loss bug: the
   readiness gate still says 21, so unmigrated BYO orgs keep routing to their own cluster, where
   the INSERT fails on the unknown column, retries, trips the breaker and drops the batch.
   Backfills the trace half from `traces` itself.
3. **Local CLI**: local schema v17 → v18, same backfill.

Both BYO and local scope their idempotency `DELETE` to `Timestamp >= (SELECT min(Timestamp) FROM
traces)` rather than deleting all trace rows. `product_events` keeps 365 days and `traces` 30, so an
unbounded delete on a _late_ re-apply would clear a year of funnel history and rebuild only a month
of it. The delete is also guarded by `(SELECT count() FROM traces) > 0`: `min()` over an empty table
is 1970, which would turn the bound back into "everything".

### Not in this cut

- **No MCP tool.** `list_product_events` still returns names only, and `inspect_trace` does not
  surface a trace's product events. An agent cannot walk the link yet; the queries and the HTTP
  routes it would sit on both exist.
- **No SDK helper.** Teams set the attributes by hand on whatever span API they already use. A
  `markProductEvent(span, name, { props, include })` in `@maple-dev/effect-sdk` would be the obvious
  next step — it is a wrapper over `setAttributes` that builds the `prop.*` keys and joins
  `include`, not new machinery, and it is where the empty-string overwrite idiom would get a name
  (`attributes: "none"`) instead of being a documented convention.
