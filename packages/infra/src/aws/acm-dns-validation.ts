/**
 * DNS validation for ACM certificates whose zone lives in Cloudflare.
 *
 * alchemy's `AWS.ACM.Certificate` validates itself only when it is given a
 * Route53 `hostedZoneId` (`Certificate.ts`, `shouldAutoValidate`). Maple's zone
 * is `maple.dev` on Cloudflare, so the certificate lands PENDING_VALIDATION and
 * the ALB's 443 listener then refuses it — the first deploy of any new
 * certificate-bearing domain fails. That gap used to be filled out of band by
 * `scripts/acm-cert-validate.sh` (curl + jq against both APIs, run after a
 * failed deploy, followed by a retry of the deploy).
 *
 * These two resources close it inside the stack, as a chain:
 *
 *   1. `AcmValidationRecord` — describes the certificate until ACM has filled
 *      in the CNAME it wants, and returns it.
 *   2. `Cloudflare.DNS.Record` — publishes that CNAME (the caller's job; it is
 *      a stock alchemy resource).
 *   3. `AcmCertificateIssued` — waits for ACM to observe the record and mark
 *      the certificate ISSUED, and re-emits the ARN so the listener can depend
 *      on the *issued* certificate rather than the requested one.
 *
 * Step 3 is a separate resource rather than part of step 1 because the wait has
 * to happen AFTER the record exists, and an alchemy resource orders itself by
 * the Outputs it consumes: it takes the published record's name, so it cannot
 * run early.
 *
 * Both are read-only against AWS — they create nothing and delete nothing, so
 * teardown is a no-op and re-running them is free.
 *
 * They are nonetheless RESOURCES rather than `Output.mapEffect` transforms over
 * the certificate's ARN, which is the shorter way to write "await something and
 * hand on a value" and is the wrong one here. `Plan.ts` resolves an `EffectExpr`
 * during PLANNING as soon as its upstream is resolved (`resolveOutput`), so
 * once the certificate exists in state, a plain `alchemy plan` — a dry run that
 * should touch nothing — would sit inside the ISSUED wait for up to ten
 * minutes. A resource's `reconcile` runs at apply only.
