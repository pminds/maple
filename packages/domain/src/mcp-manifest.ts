/**
 * The MCP registry `server.json` document for Maple's hosted MCP server.
 *
 * One definition, served from three places so they cannot drift: the API at
 * `/.well-known/mcp.json` (+ `/.well-known/mcp/server.json`), the marketing
 * site at the same paths, and — eventually — the public MCP registry. The
 * shape follows the registry schema referenced by `$schema`; the constraints
 * worth knowing are `name` (reverse-DNS namespace + `/` + server, 3–200
 * chars), `description` (1–100 chars), and a required `version`.
 *
 * Effect-free on purpose: the landing site renders this at build time and the
 * API worker's top-level module scope has to stay cheap (see `worker.ts`).
