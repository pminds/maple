 * (`Code: 62`, `position 1628`, embedded timestamps). Row values and message
 * text then entered the hash, splitting a single bug into thousands of issues.
 *   V8/JVM:          `    at getUser (/app/users.ts:42:18)`
 *   Python:          `  File "/app/main.py", line 42, in get_user`

 *
 * The Apple alternative has no source position to key on, because an iOS crash arrives
 * unsymbolicated — the app's symbols live in a dSYM that never leaves the build machine.
 * It keys on the shape instead: frame index, binary name, hex address. The offset is hex
 * (the SDK renders it that way deliberately) so `FRAME_REDACTIONS` erases it along with
 * the address, leaving `index binaryName +`. That is coarse — grouping by the sequence of
 * binaries rather than of functions — but it is *stable across releases*, which the raw
 * offsets are not: any code change shifts every offset below it and would re-split every
 * issue on every build. When dSYM symbolication lands, function names drop into the same
 * slot.
 *
 * The binary name is matched as `\\S.*`, not as one space-free token: a Mach-O image name
 * is the target's PRODUCT_NAME, and `My App` is an ordinary thing to call an app. Keying
 * on a single token silently excluded every such app from frame matching and left it
 * collapsed on the message hash — the exact failure this alternative exists to fix.

 * issue per value. The numeric passes alone were not enough: quoted identifiers
 * (`Table 'checkout_events' doesn't exist`) and query strings are pure runtime
 * values with no digit in them, and each distinct value minted its own issue.
 *
 * A quoted run is redacted only when it is unambiguously a VALUE: it contains a
 * path separator, or it is a single long token. Everything shorter is left
 * alone, because in error text a quoted short word is usually a schema
 * identifier and identifiers are bounded — `insert into "planetscale_events"`
 * and `insert into "anomaly_detector_states"` are two different bugs, and they
 * are exactly the discrimination the always-on signature exists to provide.
 * `reading 'id'` versus `reading 'name'` is the same argument.
 *
 * Both quote styles are treated alike. SQL convention says double quotes are
 * identifiers and single quotes are values, but the messages here are error
 * prose from many runtimes, not SQL, so the convention does not hold.
 *
 * The no-space rule inside each alternative is what keeps prose out: an
 * apostrophe in `doesn't` would otherwise pair with the next quote and swallow
 * the text between them.
 *
 * Route and file paths outside quotes are deliberately KEPT. `Transport error
 * (POST /api/query-engine/service-overview)` names the endpoint that failed,
 * and collapsing every path to a placeholder merges unrelated bugs into one
 * issue. Only the volatile parts of a path go: the origin (so preview hosts
 * don't split an issue), the home directory (so two users' local store paths
 * are one bug), and the query string (pure value).
 *
 * KNOWN RESIDUAL: a short entity slug still splits an issue, whether it is a
 * path segment (`/api/orgs/acme-corp/dashboards/latency-overview`) or a quoted
 * word. Nothing in the string distinguishes an org slug from a route name or a
 * table name, and every rule wide enough to catch `acme-corp` also catches
 * `service-overview` and `planetscale_events`. This is not recoverable with
 * another regex: it needs the emitting SDK to report the parameterized
 * `http.route` rather than the resolved URL. Fix it there.
 *
 * The id pass takes every digit run, not runs of 6+ — under the old threshold a
 * timestamp's two-digit hour survived and split one bug into one issue per hour
 * of the day.

/**
 * Version of the fingerprint algorithm above.
 *
 * Bumped whenever a change to frame matching, normalization, or the message
 * signature rotates hashes for errors that are still occurring. The evaluator
 * stamps it on every issue it writes, and retention archives issues carrying an
 * older version: after a bump the live bugs each get one clean issue and the
 * stale rows retire deterministically, instead of sitting in `triage` until the
 * 14-day auto-resolve window catches up.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a ClickHouse column. Old and new hashes cannot collide, so
 * the warehouse needs no discriminator — only the Postgres row does, and keeping
 * it there means a future bump is a constant change plus a sweep, with no
 * datasource migration or materialized-view backfill.
 *
 * Changing the view does NOT rewrite history: rows already in `error_events`
 * keep their v1 hashes for the rest of their 90-day TTL, so a v2 issue's detail
 * view, occurrence sparkline and sample traces all start empty and fill from
 * cutover forward. That is expected, not a regression — there is no backfill
 * short of replaying the raw traces.
 *
 * v1 → v2 (this change): frame lines are matched by shape rather than by
 * "contains a colon-digit", and the message signature is always folded in and
 * additionally strips quoted values and query strings.
 *
 * **Adding the Apple frame alternative deliberately did NOT bump this**, even
 * though it rotates hashes for iOS crashes that are still occurring, which is
 * what the rule above otherwise calls for. The retirement this version drives is
 * version-keyed, not hash-keyed: `ErrorsService` archives every `kind: "error"`
 * issue whose `fingerprintVersion` is below this constant, on the premise stated
 * in `error_issues.fingerprintVersion` that a row on an older version can never
 * receive another occurrence. That premise holds only when a bump rotates
 * *every* hash. The Apple change rotates iOS hashes alone, so a bump would
 * archive every Node, Python, Go and browser issue in every org — and nothing
 * un-archives them, because the tick's upsert conflicts on
 * `(orgId, fingerprintHash)` and never clears `archivedAt`.
 *
 * The cost of not bumping is small and bounded: the collapsed iOS issues stop
 * receiving occurrences the moment their hash changes, and retire through the
 * ordinary resolved window instead of on sight. Teaching the sweep to retire by
 * hash rather than by version is what would let a partial-rotation change bump
 * this safely.
