 * cityHash64 FingerprintHash used to group occurrences into Issues.
 *
 * Fingerprint inputs: (OrgId, ServiceName, ExceptionType, top-3 normalized frames,
 * message signature).
 * - Stack lines are filtered by frame SHAPE — one alternative per runtime's frame
 *   syntax — not by "contains `:NUMBER`". The old rule accepted any colon-digit
 *   line, so Drizzle's `params:` line (actual row values) and `Type: message`
 *   headers were hashed as frames. Over 90 days that produced 68,550 fingerprints
 *   from 114 distinct error labels; shape matching plus the signature below brings
 *   the same corpus to 2,080.
 * - Line numbers (`:123`), hex pointers (`0x...`), URL origins and Vite bundle
 *   content hashes are stripped so minor code moves, preview hosts and redeploys
 *   don't rotate the fingerprint.
 * - Top 3 frames are hashed (not just 1) so errors raised inside shared library
 *   code still distinguish between different call sites.
 * - A redacted signature of StatusMessage is folded in ALWAYS, not only when
 *   frames are absent. Bundled runtimes minify every module into one file, so the
 *   top frames alone cannot separate two bugs in the same Worker, and generic
 *   types ("HttpServerError", "Error") would monopolize one bucket per service.
 *   Redaction runs before hashing, so the signature discriminates without
 *   reintroducing cardinality.
 *
 * DeploymentEnv is intentionally NOT part of the hash: the same bug across
 * staging/prod should stay one issue; filter by env at query/triage time.
 *
 * The normalization below is mirrored in `./fingerprint.ts` (TS) for unit tests
 * across Node/Python/Java/Go stack shapes. If you change one, change both.

/**
 * Cardinality bound shared by all four `attribute_values_hourly` materializations.
 *
 * That table is an AUTOCOMPLETE INDEX — it exists so the filter builder can
 * suggest values for a key. It is read a couple of hundred times a week. With
 * `AttributeValue != ''` as its only filter it had grown to 1.59 billion rows /
 * 12.3 GB, because `ARRAY JOIN` over an attribute map turns every distinct value
 * into its own row per (org, key, hour).
 *
 * The three rules below were chosen against what was actually in the table, not
 * from intuition — measured over a 6h slice:
 *
 *   - NUMERIC MEASUREMENTS dominated: `idle_ns` (4.9M rows) and `busy_ns` (1.7M)
 *     alone were ~70% of it, with `http.request.body.size` and the
 *     `maple.ingest.*_bytes` counters behind them. Nobody picks
 *     `idle_ns = 486123904` from a dropdown. Digits-only values longer than four
 *     characters are dropped; the threshold deliberately spares HTTP status
 *     codes and ports, which are low-cardinality and genuinely pickable.
 *   - LONG VALUES: `db.query.text` averaged 864 characters, `body` 334,
 *     `http.response.header.report-to` 241, `url.full` 146. Useless as
 *     suggestions and the bulk of the bytes.
 *   - UNBOUNDED IDENTIFIERS: ids and captured HTTP headers (`cf-ray`,
 *     `x-request-id`, `traceparent`, `date`) are unique per request by
 *     definition. Matched by shape rather than by an exact key list so this
 *     generalizes past whichever keys one customer happens to emit.
 *
 * This narrows VALUE suggestions only. `attribute_keys_hourly` is untouched, so
 * every key stays discoverable and filterable — you just do not get a dropdown
 * of values for a nanosecond counter.
 *
 * Regexes use `[.]` rather than an escaped dot to keep the emitted SQL free of
 * backslash escaping across the TS template → DDL → chDB path.

/**
 * Populates the browser half of `product_events` — the product events fact table.
 *
 * A pure row-wise projection: filter to the two product-analytics event types,
 * pre-extract `domain(Url)`/`path(Url)`, re-sort by time in the target. No
 * aggregation, which is what makes this safe as a materialized view.
 *
 * That distinction is load-bearing, because the neighbouring table is not.
 * `session_replays` is a `ReplacingMergeTree(Version)` whose SDK writes a v1 row
 * at session start and a v2 row at session end. A materialized view fires per
 * *inserted block*, so it would see those as two independent sessions and
 * evaluate any per-session predicate against half a session — `PageViews <= 1`
 * against the v1 row (where `PageViews` is 0) would report every session as a
 * bounce, which is exactly the bug `webAnalyticsSummaryQuery`'s doc comment
 * records having shipped once already. `session_events` has no such hazard: it
 * is an append-only MergeTree with no dedup and no versioning, so per-block
 * firing is irrelevant here.
 *
 * `Type` is carried through as `Kind` rather than folded into `EventName`, so
 * the page-view predicate stays provably identical to the pre-rollup
 * `Type = 'navigation'` even if a customer calls `track('$pageview')`.
 *
 * `Source` is the literal `'browser'`: this view is the only writer of browser
 * rows, and the backfill deletes by it. Identity columns are copied through from
 * the SDK-stamped `session_events` row — never joined from `session_replays`,
 * whose v1/v2 rows may land after the event.
 *
 * Column order must match the `product_events` SCHEMA order — enforced by
 * `materialized-projection-order.test.ts`.
