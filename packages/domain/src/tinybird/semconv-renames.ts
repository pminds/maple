// Coalescing expressions for OpenTelemetry attribute renames.
//
// Semconv renames keys; instrumentation in the wild does not update in lockstep.
// Anything that reads a renamed key has to accept BOTH spellings, or it silently
// loses the attribute for whichever half of the fleet uses the other one — an
// empty environment column, a service-map node collapsed onto the wrong label.
// Each expression here is used in two places that MUST agree byte-for-byte:
// the materialized view that pre-extracts the value at write time, and the
// query-engine builder that reads it off the raw table.
//
// Renames whose keys are only ever surfaced (never keyed on) live in the
// recommendation dictionary in `../recommendations.ts` instead.
