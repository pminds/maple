 *   - `public` — anyone holding the link, no sign-in.
 *   - `org`    — any signed-in member of the dashboard's own org.
 *
 * The security property that shapes every schema here: **a share link is a
 * credential anyone may hold, so the holder never supplies a query.** The
 * viewer-facing payloads carry a `widgetId` and the controls the viewer is
 * allowed to change (time range, variable values) and nothing else — no
 * `QuerySpec`, no endpoint name, no params, no SQL. Query construction happens
 * on the server from the stored dashboard document. That invariant is enforced
 * here, in the schema, rather than by a check somewhere downstream.
