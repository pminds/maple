/**
 * The iOS Home Screen widgets' one read.
 *
 * A separate resource family rather than a shaped view over `/v2/error_issues`
 * + `/v2/services` + `/v2/traces/timeseries`, for two reasons that are not
 * "three requests is more than one":
 *
 * 1. **It is the credential's fence.** `requiredScopeForRoute` derives an API
 *    key's required scope from the first path segment, so a key scoped
 *    `widget_summary:read` can reach exactly this endpoint and nothing else.
 *    Composed from the generic endpoints, the same widget would need
 *    `error_issues:read` + `services:read` + `traces:read` — an organization
 *    read key, sitting on a phone. For the same reason this must never be
 *    nested under another family's prefix.
 * 2. **A widget extension has no budget to compose.** It is woken by WidgetKit
 *    with seconds of wall clock and tens of megabytes, and it deliberately does
 *    not link the generated client. One request it can decode by hand is the
 *    only shape that fits.
 *
 * The windows are the server's, not the caller's: "ongoing issues" and "traffic
 * right now" are product definitions the widgets render, and a query parameter
 * would let two builds of the app disagree about what the Home Screen means.
 *
 * `deployment_environment` is a parameter anyway, and the two are not in
 * tension. A window is what the Home Screen *means*; an environment is which
 * slice of the organization the person holding the phone asked to look at. The
 * server cannot know the second, and two builds cannot disagree about it —
 * whatever they send comes back echoed on the response.
