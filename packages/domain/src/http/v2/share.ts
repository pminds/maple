/**
 * The viewer-facing share surface, on v2.
 *
 * **The one v2 group with no `AuthorizationV2` middleware**, and the only one
 * whose operations are not bearer-authenticated. That is not an oversight and
 * it is not a gap in the scope model — a share link is a credential in itself,
 * carried in the request body, and the whole proposition is that it resolves
 * for someone with no Maple account at all. Requiring a bearer here would mean
 * the link only worked for people who did not need it.
 *
 * Consequences worth knowing before adding to this group:
 *
 *   - `requiredScopeForRoute` would derive the family `share` from the path,
 *     but it is only ever called by `ApiAuthorizationV2Layer`, which these
 *     routes do not run. There is no `share:read` scope and nothing issues one.
 *   - The operations publish `security: []`. That is derived from the absent
 *     middleware, not annotated, and it is accurate: no credential is required.
 *     An `org`-mode link *reads* a session token when one is present, but
 *     OpenAPI's `security` describes what is required, not what is consulted.
 *   - `openapi.test.ts` exempts these operations from the "every operation
 *     is bearer-secured and declares a 401" invariant, by name. The exemption is
 *     an allowlist so a third public operation cannot appear silently.
 *
 * Every endpoint is a POST, and the ones that take a token take it in the
 * **body**, never the path. The web URL is `/share/<token>`, but the API need
 * not mirror it, and keeping the token out of `url.full` means it never reaches
 * a span attribute, an access log, or a `Referer` — no tracer suppression rule
 * required.
 *
 * `alertChart` is not about a shared dashboard at all — it lives here because
 * this is the API's one unauthenticated surface, and it is unauthenticated for
 * the same reason: the image is fetched by Slack's and Discord's servers, which
 * hold no Maple credential. Like `ogCard` it takes a signed id, never a token,
 * and that id pins the rule and the window it may read.
 *
 * `ogCard` is the one operation that names a share without a token at all. It
 * cannot have one: it exists so a social-preview image can be drawn, and an
 * `og:image` is a URL that travels to every crawler and chat client that
 * unfurls the link. It takes a signed share id instead (`shareOgId`), which is
 * not a credential and cannot be turned back into a token.
