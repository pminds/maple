/**
 * Migration 0024 — `ai_trace_index`, the Agent Sessions detection surface.
 *
 * Detecting agent traces by `mapContains(SpanAttributes, 'maple_ai.vendor.id')`
 * on raw `traces` cannot be indexed at production shape: GenAI spans are ~0.01%
 * of rows but arrive continuously — about one per index granule — so the
 * `mapKeys(SpanAttributes)` bloom prunes nothing and the scan reads the fat Map
 * column for every span in the window. Measured 2026-08-29 against production:
 * ~3.6s for a one-hour window, dead at the gateway's 15s kill by a day, and the
 * Agent Sessions page wants 30.
 *
 * `ai_trace_index` is a filtered projection (the `error_events` shape): only
 * the vendor-stamped spans, with the `maple_ai.*` identity pre-extracted to
 * plain columns. Roughly 10k narrow rows per day at current volume, against
 * 70M raw spans. `aiSessionPageQuery` (which ranks a page of sessions),
 * `aiSessionListQuery`'s index levels and `aiSessionFacetsQuery` read it; the
 * per-trace fan-out reads `trace_detail_spans` for the page's traces alone,
 * which is where every other fact about an agent span (its status, its failure
 * attributes, its vendor version) is read from.
 *
 * NOTHING IS BACKFILLED here: a materialized view sees inserts from creation
 * forward, so windows predating this migration under-report until the raw
 * table's 30-day TTL ages the gap out (agent tracing shipped 2026-08-20, so
 * the gap is small and shrinking).
 *
 * `requiredForIngest: false` — nothing writes `ai_trace_index` directly; the
 * gateway keeps writing `traces` and the view fans out inside ClickHouse.
 * Gating ingest on it would un-ready every BYO-ClickHouse org for a read-path
 * addition.
 *
 * The CREATE statements below are the verbatim DDL as the schema emitter
 * produced it at v24. Frozen history: never re-derive it from a later snapshot.
