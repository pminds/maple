/**
 * 0027 — `audit_log`: the org-wide audit trail, moved out of Postgres.
 *
 * Written only by the API worker through the managed Tinybird pipeline and read
 * only by the admin-gated `GET /v2/audit_log`. It ships in the migration set so
 * every ClickHouse the schema is applied to mirrors the managed table; a
 * BYO-ClickHouse org never reads or writes it — reads are pinned to the managed
 * route (`INGEST_PINNED_TABLES`).
 *
 * `requiredForIngest: false`: the ingest gateway writes nothing here, so the
 * table's presence must not gate an org's ingest readiness.
 *
 * Retention is six years (HIPAA §164.316(b)(2)); `''` stands in for absent
 * values throughout — see the datasource definition for the column contract.
