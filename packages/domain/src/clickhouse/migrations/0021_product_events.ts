/**
 * Migration 0021 — product events: `web_events` becomes `product_events`.
 *
 * Three things, in order:
 *
 * 1. `session_events` gains `VisitorId`/`UserId`/`GroupId` (all `DEFAULT ''`),
 *    stamped per event by the SDK. Metadata-only `ADD COLUMN`s, like 0011.
 * 2. `product_events` replaces `web_events`: same time-first fact table, plus
 *    `Source` (`browser`/`server`/`mobile`), the person key, `ServiceName`, and
 *    a 365-day TTL. Backends and mobile apps write it directly via
 *    `POST /v1/events`; browser rows arrive through `product_events_mv`. The
 *    browser half is backfilled from `session_events` (its 30-day window is all
 *    there is), and `web_events` + its view are dropped — every reader moved to
 *    the new table in the same release, and the old one cannot be rebuilt past
 *    what the new one now holds.
 * 3. `identity_links` — (VisitorId, UserId) pairs out of `session_replays`,
 *    the stitch between a person's anonymous marketing visit and their
 *    identified/server-side events. Backfilled from `session_replays` for the
 *    same 30-day reason.
 *
 * Re-runnable by construction: views are dropped first, `product_events`
 * clears only `Source = 'browser'` (never a directly ingested row), and
 * `identity_links` is an AggregatingMergeTree over `min(FirstSeen)`, so a
 * re-insert of a pair collapses back to the same earliest-sighting row.
 *
 * **BYO ClickHouse only.** Managed orgs get `product_events_mv` /
 * `identity_links_mv` via `tinybird deploy` from `materializations.ts`, and the
 * populate is an explicit `tb` step at deploy time (see 0014's note; the SDK has
 * no populate option).
 *
 * `requiredForIngest` stays at its default (true) this time: the ingest gateway
 * writes `session_events` with the three new columns and `product_events`
 * directly, and a cluster without them rejects those rows.
