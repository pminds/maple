 * Only the HEIGHT is measured, and that is the documented shape.

 * it caused a mount flash: `width` is optional, and the host renders
 * `width: width === undefined ? "100%" : width` (`dist/react/RendererChart.js`),
 * so omitting it makes the chart follow its container. The renderer then
 * installs its OWN `ResizeObserver` on the container (`dist/renderer.js:151`)
 * and — this is the part that matters — `adapter.mount()` runs inside a layout
 * effect and `createScene()` reads `container.getBoundingClientRect().width`
 * synchronously there (`dist/renderer.js:659`), so the first paint is already
 * correctly sized.
 *
 * Taking that over meant gating the chart behind our own observer, whose first
 * record only arrives during a LATER frame's rendering steps: mount → paint an
 * empty card → observer fires → re-render → paint the chart. Two blank frames
 * minimum, each with its own commit.
 *
 * The guide is explicit — omit `width` to follow the container, and choose
 * `height` OR `aspectRatio` but never both:
 * https://tanstack.com/charts/v0/docs/guides/responsive-charts
 *
 * `height` still has to be a number, because the scene height comes from
 * `options.height ?? 320` and is never read back off the container
 * (`dist/renderer.js:664`) — a CSS `height: 100%` would give a full-height host
 * drawing a 320px scale. These charts live in a flex column whose spare height
 * depends on whether a legend wrapped, so the number has to be measured.
