/**
 * Sequential colour scales for the TanStack charts spike.
 *
 * ## The scale is d3's, exactly as the docs prescribe
 *
 * `@tanstack/charts-scales@0.16.0` ships **band / linear / ordinal / point only** —
 * there is no colour scale in the package. The documented escape hatch (the
 * Legends and Color guide) is a d3 sequential scale: `ChartColorOptions.scale` is
 * typed as `ConfiguredColorScaleLike`, which is exactly d3's shape, and `d3-scale`
 * is a direct dependency of `apps/web` (the trace scatter already hands `scaleLog`
 * to its y axis). So `createSequentialColorScale` below is a thin wrapper over
 * `scaleSequential` / `scaleSequentialLog` — the domain / ticks / copy plumbing
 * this file used to hand-roll is d3's problem again.
 *
 * Two runtime facts verified against `@tanstack/charts/dist` keep that safe:
 *
 * - **The legend still classifies it `"continuous"`.** `colorScaleKind()`
 *   (`dist/scales.js:135`) returns `"continuous"` for a scale exposing `ticks`
 *   and none of `quantiles` / `thresholds` / `invertExtent`. d3's `sequential()`
 *   is `linearish(...)` and `sequentialLog()` is `loggish(...)`
 *   (`d3-scale/src/sequential.js`), so both carry `ticks` / `tickFormat` / `nice`
 *   and nothing from the quantile/threshold families — `colorGradientLegend`
 *   renders. (Surprise: `@types/d3-scale`'s `ScaleSequentialBase` omits `ticks`
 *   entirely; classification is a runtime property probe, so the types are
 *   irrelevant to it.)
 * - **`copy()` marks it a configured instance, not a factory.**
 *   `isColorScaleFactory` is `!("copy" in source)` (`dist/scales.js:79`), and
 *   every d3 scale has `copy` — so the runtime takes the configured branch, treats
 *   the pinned domain as authoritative, and never infers one from the colour
 *   channel. That is precisely what both call sites want: the heatmap pins
 *   `[min, max]` it computed itself, and the trace scatter pins a fixed density
 *   estimate the transform makes unknowable (see `DENSITY_DOMAIN` there).
 *
 * ## Why the interpolator is still hand-rolled
 *
 * `scaleSequential` accepts any `(t: number) => string`, and d3's stock
 * interpolators cannot produce Maple's ramps: `d3-scale-chromatic` palettes are
 * fixed, and anything routed through `d3-color` chokes on `var(--token)` — `NaN`
 * channels, rendered black. The stops live in `tokens.css` as
 * `--heatmap-<name>-0..4` and are resolved to `oklch(...)` literals via
 * `usePlotColors` (re-resolved on theme flip) *before* they reach the ramp, so the
 * interpolator handed to d3 is a closure over resolved literals.
 *
 * The production heatmap
 * (`packages/ui/src/components/charts/heatmap/query-builder-heatmap-chart.tsx`)
 * blends flanking stops with CSS `color-mix(in oklch, …)` and lets the browser do
 * the mixing. Canvas takes literal colours, so that trick is unavailable to a
 * shared chart definition — `mixOklch` below reproduces `color-mix(in oklch, …)`
 * numerically: componentwise on L and C, shorter-arc on H, which is what the CSS
 * Color 4 `oklch` interpolation rule specifies.
