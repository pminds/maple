 * threading an `idPrefix` prop down from every call site — prop-drilling a
 * uniqueness concern the component can own.
 *
 * `useId()` alone is not enough: React 19 returns `«r0»`, and those brackets
 * inside a `fill="url(#…)"` reference are a portability risk across the SVG and
 * canvas renderers. Sanitizing to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` is stable under any

/**
 * A dasharray that actually reads as dashes under a `lineY` mark.
 *
 * `lineY` hard-codes `lineCap: "round"` / `lineJoin: "round"` on every line node
 * it emits (`dist/line.js:126-127` at 0.16.0) and `LineYOptions` exposes no `lineCap`, so
 * a semicircular cap of radius `strokeWidth / 2` is added to BOTH ends of every
 * dash. A `"4 4"` that reads crisply under a butt cap paints `4 + strokeWidth`
 * of ink against a `4 - strokeWidth` gap here — at a 2.5px stroke that is 6.5px
 * on, 1.5px off, which is why an unadjusted dashed line reads as a wobbly solid
 * one.
 *
 * The fix is geometry, not taste: take the cap out of the dash and give it to
 * the gap. `on` and `off` are the widths you want to SEE.
 *
 * This applies to `lineY` and `areaY` only. `barY` emits rect nodes with butt
 * caps, so its dasharrays must NOT go through here.
