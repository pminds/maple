/**
 * The non-plotted states of a chart — loading, empty, error — as one system.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Every async chart renders the same three branches, and before this each one
 * spelled them out by hand. The result was drift in every dimension that is
 * supposed to be a constant: `rounded-none` vs `rounded-md` vs `rounded-lg` on
 * the skeleton, `font-mono text-[11px]` vs `text-xs` on the message, a
 * `border-destructive/40 bg-destructive/5` error box copied verbatim across four
 * files. None of that is a per-chart decision, so none of it belongs at a call
 * site.
 *
 * ## The height is the load-bearing part
 *
 * A chart's plot height was repeated as a magic number in each branch — the
 * skeleton's `h-[280px]`, the error box's `h-[280px]`, and the plot's own
 * `height={CHART_HEIGHT}` — three copies that had to be edited together and
 * silently disagreed when they weren't. {@link ChartPlotArea} declares it ONCE
 * and the states read it from context, so a branch can no longer reserve a
 * different box than the chart it stands in for. That is what keeps the swap-in
 * from jumping.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT unified to a single global height: infra detail (200), host
 * (220) and k8s (280) plot at genuinely different sizes. This makes the number a
 * per-chart declaration instead of a per-branch literal — it does not flatten
 * the sizes themselves.
 */
