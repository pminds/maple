/**
 * How a series of buckets collapses to the single number a consumer needs.
 *
 * Two vocabularies exist and they are NOT merged: widgets persist `"first"`
 * (`reduceToValue.aggregate` on a stat or gauge tile) and alert rules persist
 * `"identity"` (`alert_rules.reducer`). They coincide only on a one-bucket
 * window, so collapsing the literal sets would silently rewrite stored values on
 * both sides.
 *
 * What IS shared is the table below. Both sets are derived from it and the
 * mapping between them is total, so adding a reducer is one edit and a reducer
 * that has no counterpart fails to compile rather than falling through at
 * runtime.
