// AI agent sessions — read side
//
// The ingest gateway stamps three attributes on AI-agent spans at decode time
// (`apps/ingest/src/ai_session.rs`): `maple_ai.vendor.id`,
// `maple_ai.vendor.version` and `maple_ai.session.id`. Only the last one is
// sparse — a vendor exposes a session key on the spans that own the turn
// (`ai.eve.turn`, `invoke_agent`), never on the sibling `chat`, `execute_tool`,
// `workflow.*` or HTTP-client spans it fans out to.
//
// So a session is resolved at TRACE granularity: a trace belongs to a session
// if ANY of its spans carries that session id, and then EVERY span of that
// trace is part of the session — including the completely non-AI ones. That is
// deliberate; the dashboard shows the full agent context, not just the spans
// the framework happened to label.
//
// A trace can carry no session id at all and still be an agent run: several
// vendors (haystack, litellm, llamaindex, semantic_kernel, effect_ai) expose no
// session key, and the `unknown:*` buckets never do. Those traces used to be
// invisible here. They are now sessions of one trace, keyed
// `trace:<TraceId>` (`MAPLE_AI_TRACE_SESSION_PREFIX`) — the same page, with the
// single trace as the whole context. That is why detection keys on the VENDOR
// stamp rather than the session one: the vendor id is on every span the gateway
// classified as GenAI, so it is the marker that finds both populations, and the
// session id becomes a grouping key rather than an admission test.
//
// The list is that fan-out, in two stages against two different tables — and
// two round trips, because the second is bounded by what the first found:
//
//   page — `aiSessionPageQuery`, over `ai_trace_index`: the filtered
//     projection holding ONLY the vendor-stamped spans (~0.01% of rows),
//     pre-extracted to plain columns by `ai_trace_index_mv`. It is the one
//     level that sees the caller's whole window, and the one that can afford
//     to: ~10k narrow rows a day against 70M raw spans, ~600ms cold over 30
//     days of production. It resolves every trace to its session key, ranks
//     the sessions by their first agent span, and yields one page of session
//     ids with the bounds of their agent spans — nothing else.
//   fan out — `aiSessionListQuery`, over `trace_detail_spans`, restricted to
//     that page's traces by `TraceId IN (…)`. `TraceId` is a sort-key prefix
//     there (`(OrgId, TraceId, SpanId)`), so this is a seek. The same fan-out
//     against raw `traces` times out at 10s on a 7-day window in production:
//     that table is sorted `(OrgId, ServiceName, SpanName, Timestamp)` and
//     `idx_trace_id` is only a bloom skip index, which prunes far too little
//     at this org's volume.
//
// Detection used to run the vendor predicate against raw `traces` behind the
// `mapKeys(SpanAttributes)` bloom skip index, and that shape cannot be saved:
// GenAI spans arrive continuously — about one per index granule at production
// volume — so the bloom prunes nothing and the scan reads the fat Map column
// for EVERY span in the window. Measured 2026-08-29 in production: ~3.6s for a
// one-hour window, dead at the 15s kill by a day. The index is the same
// predicate applied at insert time.
//
// The fan-out used to run over every qualifying trace in the window and page
// with LIMIT/OFFSET afterwards, and that shape cannot be saved either — by the
// index or by anything else. `trace_detail_spans` sits on object storage, and
// what a seek costs there is set by the partitions it touches, not by the rows
// it returns: measured 2026-09-02 in production, five trace ids across the 32
// retained partitions ran past 10s, while a page's worth of sessions inside
// one partition took 1.3–2.8s cold and ~300ms warm. The old shape read three
// partitions for a one-day window (5–15s, eight of 31 reads killed at the 15s
// ceiling over three days) and all of them for the 30-day window the page
// offers (killed, every time). Paging first is what bounds the fan-out to the
// hours a page spans.
//
// `IN` rather than a JOIN for the fan-out, the same reason
// `errorDetailTracesQuery` uses it — ClickHouse pushes the id set into the
// read, which a JOIN does not do. The JOIN the list DOES carry is one level up,
// between two derived tables of at most a page of traces each, and it is there
// so the fan-out takes the session key the page resolved rather than deriving
// its own from the spans: two derivations over two windows can disagree, and
// a disagreement would drop the row from the page it was ranked into.
//
// The index fills forward from its deploy: rows already in `traces` when the MV
// was created are not in it until a backfill runs, so the page (and the
// facets) can under-report windows that predate the deploy. The fan-out and the
// per-session reads still see every span of any trace the page finds.
//
// The window predicate on the fan-out is the PAGE's, not the caller's: the
// bounds of the page's agent spans, padded by `FAN_OUT_PAD_SECONDS` so a
// trace's non-agent spans on either side are counted too. `trace_detail_spans`
// is `PARTITION BY toDate(Timestamp)`, so the predicate is the only thing that
// prunes partitions there. What that buys depends on how densely an org runs
// agents: at production volume a page of sessions ordered by start spans
// hours — one partition, two around midnight — while an org with a few
// sessions a day has a first page that spans weeks, and its fan-out probes
// every partition in between exactly as the old shape did (no worse, no
// better; a chunked or per-partition fan-out is the follow-up if that bites).
//
// A caller that has no window — a deep link carrying only a session id —
// resolves one with `aiSessionWindowQuery` first, rather than running the
// fan-out unpruned. That query still reads raw `traces`, and can: it prunes by
// the session id VALUE, which the `mapValues(SpanAttributes)` bloom index does
// serve (the id is rare), unlike the presence-of-key detection this file moved
// off `traces` — and the table's 30-day TTL bounds what is left.
//
// A `trace:` id needs neither the attribute detection nor the fan-out: it names
// the trace outright, so `aiTraceWindowQuery`/`aiTraceSpansQuery` are the same
// two reads with `TraceId = {traceId}` in place of the detection subquery —
// `idx_trace_id` on `traces` for the bounds, the `(OrgId, TraceId, SpanId)`
// sort key on `trace_detail_spans` for the spans.
//
// Tenant scoping: a subquery contributes nothing to the outer query's scope, so
// every level that reads a table repeats `OrgId = {orgId}` itself. The outermost
// level of `aiSessionListQuery` reads a derived table rather than a table, and
// inherits `org` scope from it.

 *
 * The page reads it over the caller's window; the aggregation over the page's

 * trace's index rows all lie between its session's `agentStart` and `agentEnd`,

 * carries two session ids and only the lesser one falls inside the page's
 * bounds, which no vendor has been seen to produce.
 *
 * `rawSessionId` is `max` over the trace's index rows because the session id
 * sits on the turn-owning span alone (see the file header) and every other row

 * so a row predicate ANDing `Model IN (…)` with `ToolName IN (…)` could only

 * sees the caller's whole window. See the file header for why the fan-out
 * cannot.
 *
 * Detection admits any trace with a GenAI span, and the session id then groups
 * rather than admits: a trace that carries one is filed under it — with the
 * session's other traces — and a trace that carries none becomes a session of
 * its own, keyed `trace:<TraceId>`. Sessionless is the normal state for whole
 * vendors, not an edge case; see this file's header.
 *
 * Ordered by the first AGENT span, not the first span of any kind: the index
 * carries only agent spans, and the two differ by under a second in practice
 * (see `FAN_OUT_PAD_SECONDS`). The row's `startTime` still reports the true
 * first span; the caller keeps the page in this order rather than re-sorting
 * by it, so what is shown is the order that was paged. A measure sort
 * (`sortBy`) orders by that measure first, with the first agent span and then
 * `sessionId` breaking ties, so a page boundary never splits two sessions that
 * share a start.
 *
 * The session-level filters are `HAVING` on the ranked row, over the measures
 * the index carries per span, and cost nothing beyond the index scan the page
 * already is. What they cannot do is count — a facet for "sessions over $1"
 * would be another pass over the same index per bucket, which the sidebar
 * does not ask for.
 *
 * The remaining gap is between traces, not inside one: a session whose OTHER
 * traces lie entirely outside the range is still found only by the traces that
 * touched it, which needs a session-keyed table to fix and not a wider window.

/**
 * One row per session of the page `aiSessionPageQuery` ranked, with every

 * two reads. Bounded by the page alone: `fanOutStart`/`fanOutEnd` are the
 * extent of the page's agent spans, and both the index reads and the fan-out
 * run inside them (padded, for the fan-out) — see `indexTraces` for why the
 * index level resolves a page trace exactly as the page did without the
 * caller's window.
 *
 * `vendorId` is the vendor of the EARLIEST span that carries a session id, not
 * `max(vendorId)`. A single trace legitimately carries several vendors — an eve
 * agent calls through the Vercel AI SDK — and `max` picked `vercel_ai_sdk`
 * alphabetically over `eve` when `eve` was the framework actually running the
 * turn. The root-most session-bearing span is the one that names the framework,
 * so the two `argMin`s (per trace, then across traces) resolve to it. A trace
 * with no session-bearing span falls to the next rank of the same ordering —
 * its earliest vendor-stamped span, which is that trace's root-most agent span.
 *
 * The filters land on the index level, which means "the trace's agent spans
 * came from this service" rather than "the trace touched this service". A
 * trace spans services by definition, so the alternative — filtering the
 * fan-out — would silently drop spans and under-count `spanCount`. The agent
 * spans come from the agent's own service, which is the one a user filtering by
 * service means.
 *
 * Once a trace is on the page it is aggregated across the padded fan-out window
 * rather than the caller's, so `startTime`/`endTime`/`durationMs`/`spanCount`/
 * `errorSpanCount`/`serviceNames` describe the whole trace rather than the
 * slice of it that fell inside the range — a session that began an hour before
 * the range no longer reports the range edge as its start, and the detail page
 * can read the bounds this row carries as the session's own.
 *
 * Ordered by `startTime` for a caller that reads it alone; the list's caller
 * re-imposes the page's order, which this row cannot know.

 * the trace, so there is nothing to resolve and `TraceId` is a sort-key prefix
 * of `trace_detail_spans`. Everything else is identical, deliberately — same
 * projection, same row schema, same tie-broken order, same truncation contract —
 * so the detail page reads one shape whichever kind of session it opened.
 *
 * The window is still required and still bounds the read: `TraceId` prunes the
 * sort key, the `Timestamp` predicate prunes partitions, and only both together
 * keep this off every partition the table retains.
