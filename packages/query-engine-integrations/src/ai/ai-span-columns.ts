// The session's usage and model calls, counted by the detail page's rules —
// one level deep, which is the shape every roll-up in production has, where
// the page walks the whole ancestry.
//
// `ai_trace_index` carries every GenAI span's tokens and cost (migration
// 0026, `@maple/domain/tinybird/gen-ai-columns`) and, since 0029, the
// provider's response id. Three things would otherwise inflate a session:
//
// - A wrapper's roll-up: several frameworks stamp `gen_ai.usage.*` on the
//   model span AND sum it onto the agent span that wraps it.
//   `countableUsageSpans` in `apps/web/src/lib/agent-sessions/session-summary.ts`
//   charges each reporter to its nearest reporting ancestor and keeps only the
//   excess; {@link sessionUsageSum} is that rule in SQL, one level deep, which
//   is the shape every roll-up in production has.
// - A sub-step of a call: a gateway records its provider attempts as model
//   spans under the model span (OpenRouter's `provider attempt N`), and an SDK
//   wraps `doGenerate` in `generateText`. A model span that reports no usage
//   while its parent does, or whose reported usage its children already
//   account for, is the same call seen again, not another call —
//   {@link sessionLlmCalls}.
// - A second observation: a gateway that forwards its own trace of the call
//   (OpenRouter Broadcast, Helicone, …) lands it in the same session as a
//   separate trace, so the parent/child netting cannot see it. The provider's
//   response id is the one fact both observations carry, so reporters sharing
//   one are the same call: its usage is the larger of the two claims (a
//   gateway prices a call the app's SDK could not), and it is one call.
//   Reporters without an id are counted as they are — the page does not
//   guess.
