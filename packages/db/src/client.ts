 *

 * client may be reused freely WITHIN a request but must never outlive it. The
 * request path holds one of these per request (`maxConnections: 1`) and `end()`s
 * it at the boundary — see apps/api/src/platform/pg-connection-scope.ts.
 * `fetch_types: false` skips the pg_types round-trip (we only use built-in
 * types).
 *
 * `prepare: false` because the named-statement cache is per connection: a
 * request-lived client would have to re-issue every statement's Parse on the
 * next request anyway, and named statements are the classic way to pin a
 * connection in a pooler. Hyperdrive multiplexes client connections over its
 * origin pool, so the unnamed extended protocol is the safer default.
 * Cloudflare's own example now suggests `prepare: true`; that only pays off
 * across reuse of one long-lived connection, which a request-lived client by
 * definition does not have. Do not flip it back without measuring.
