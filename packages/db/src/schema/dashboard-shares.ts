/**
 * Share links for a dashboard, or for a single widget on one.
 *
 * `widget_id` is the scope: null means the whole board, set means exactly that
 * one chart. A widget share is a first-class link with its own token, mode and
 * revocation — not a view of the dashboard's share — so a public embed of one
 * chart survives its dashboard being flipped to org-only or unshared entirely.
 *
 * At most one live row per (dashboard, widget) scope, enforced by the partial
 * unique index below. A dashboard may therefore have its own link plus one per
 * widget, all live at once, which is the point.
 *
 * `mode` rather than one row per mode: toggling public <-> org-only has to keep
 * the same URL working, or a link already pasted into a chat silently changes
 * meaning. Two rows would also mean two live URLs for one scope and no answer
 * to "which one did I share".
 *
 * Revoke and rotate are the same operation — stamp `revoked_at` on the current
 * row, and (for rotate) insert a fresh one in the same transaction. Revoked
 * rows are kept for audit and can never resurrect, because every resolution
 * filters `revoked_at is null`.
