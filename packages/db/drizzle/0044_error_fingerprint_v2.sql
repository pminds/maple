-- Cutover for fingerprint algorithm v2.
--
-- v2 matches stack frames by shape instead of by "contains a colon-digit", so
-- every error-kind hash rotates. The old rows can never receive another
-- occurrence and would otherwise sit in `triage` until the 14-day resolved
-- window retired them one by one. Over 90 days they numbered 68,550 for 114
-- distinct error labels; the same corpus fingerprints to ~2,000 under v2.
--
-- Scoped to kind = 'error'. Alert- and integration-kind issues key off
-- `alert:{ruleId}:{groupKey}`-style identifiers, not the ClickHouse fingerprint,
-- so their state is still valid and is deliberately left alone.
--
-- Warehouse side: changing the materialized view does NOT rewrite history.
-- Rows already in error_events keep their v1 hashes for the rest of their
-- 90-day TTL, so every issue created after this migration starts with an empty
-- detail view, sparkline and sample-trace list and fills from here forward.
-- Expected, not a bug report — there is no backfill short of replaying traces.
--
-- The tick cursor (error_tick_states) is NOT reset: the evaluator picks up from
-- where it left off and re-creates an issue the next time each live bug fires,
-- which for anything actually firing is within a tick. Resetting it would force
-- a full bootstrap re-scan for no benefit.
