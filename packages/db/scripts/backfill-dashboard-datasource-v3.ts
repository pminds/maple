/**
 * One-shot backfill: rewrite every stored dashboard document's data sources from
 * the v2 `{ endpoint, params }` bag to the v3 discriminated union.
 *
 * Runs ONCE per branch. There is no lazy read-path upgrade for v2 -> v3 — the
 * deployed code decodes v3 only — so between deploying that code and finishing
 * this run, un-backfilled dashboards fail to load. Keep the gap short.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run db:backfill:dashboards-v3 --branch main            # dry run (default)
 *   bun run db:backfill:dashboards-v3 --branch main --apply
 *   bun run db:backfill:dashboards-v3 --url postgres://…       # local rehearsal
 *   bun run db:backfill:dashboards-v3 --url … --restore-from dump.jsonl
 *
 * Safety properties, each of which exists for a specific failure:
 *
 *   - DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT. `--apply` is the only thing that writes.
 *   - "Done" is decided STRUCTURALLY (`isDocumentV3`), never by a flag or a
 *     version column, so re-running is inherently a no-op and no lost cursor can
 *     cause a double transform.
 *   - Every row is DECODED as v3 after transform. A row that fails is left byte
 *     identical and reported; writing a document we could not decode is the one
 *     irreversible mistake available here.
 *   - The pre-write JSONL journal is APPENDED AND FSYNCED before the batch it
 *     covers — for dashboards and for dashboard_versions snapshots — so a crash
 *     mid-run still leaves every already-written row recoverable. Each line
 *     carries the preimage AND the exact upgraded payload about to be written:
 *     restore only touches a row that still holds that exact payload, so a
 *     CAS-missed backfill row (whose version N+1 belongs to a concurrent user
 *     edit) is skipped instead of having the user's edit replaced by the stale
 *     preimage. Restore advances `version` rather than rolling it back — the
 *     counter is an optimistic-concurrency token and must stay monotonic, or a
 *     stale tab holding the pre-backfill version could CAS over the restore.
 *   - Writes CAS on `version`. Not bumping it would not avoid disturbing clients
 *     (the change streams over Electric either way) — it would let a stale tab
 *     win the compare-and-swap and silently overwrite the backfill with v2.
 *     Bumping turns that into the `DashboardConcurrencyError` every writer
 *     already retries.
 *   - `updated_at` is NOT touched: it is user-visible and the dashboard list's
 *     sort key (`dashboards_org_updated_idx`). A backfill that reshuffles every
 *     customer's list is a visible regression for zero benefit.
 *   - Keyset pagination on `(org_id, id)`, never OFFSET — rows move under you as
 *     you write. One small transaction per batch, not per run: a single large
 *     transaction holds locks against live writers and lands on Electric as one
 *     enormous change that forces every connected browser to resync at once.
 *
 * `dashboard_versions.snapshot_json` gets a second pass AFTER the dashboards
 * pass, so a partial run still leaves live documents correct. Those snapshots are
 * read through the same hard-failing `parsePayload`, so leaving them in v2 breaks
 * the version-history page, not merely restore. They are not Electric-streamed,
 * so they carry no open-tab risk.
