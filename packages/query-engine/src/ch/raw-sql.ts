/**
 * Why a query is handwritten SQL rather than a builder query.
 *
 * This union is the boundary between legitimate raw SQL and raw SQL nobody got
 * round to converting — and adding a member is the review gate. It is a
 * one-line diff in this file that a reviewer cannot miss, and it travels with
 * the definition, so it survives file moves and copy-paste into new packages in
 * a way a checked-in call-site list or a lint rule with an allowlist of paths
 * does not.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `"legacy"` or `"todo"` member. With one, the gate is
 * decorative.

 *
 * `rowSchema` is required for every reason whose columns are known up front — see

 * from, so a forgotten schema is a silent identity cast: `decodeRows` hands the
 * wire values straight through, and a 64-bit count arriving quoted reaches a
 * consumer as a string. The catalog gates only see queries a fixture compiles;
 * this sees every call site.

 * at all; they never produce a `CompiledQuery`.
