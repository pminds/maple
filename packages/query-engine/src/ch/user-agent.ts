// Bot classification over a raw `User-Agent` string.
//
// The browser SDK records a session for anything that executes the beacon, and
// a crawler is not distinguishable from a visitor by any column we store: the
// SDK's own parser reports Googlebot as Chrome / Android / mobile, because that
// is literally what its UA claims to be. Every number on the Web Analytics page
// counted crawlers as people until this existed — on one org that meant 11,431
// of 11,491 "unique visitors" were Googlebot.
//
// COVERAGE CEILING, and it is a low one: this classifies what the browser SDK
// saw, and a crawler only lands in `session_replays` if it executes JavaScript.
// Measured across the whole platform over 14 days, that is Google, Yandex,
// Applebot and a long tail — and *zero* sessions from GPTBot, ClaudeBot,
// PerplexityBot or OAI-SearchBot, all of which fetch without running the page.
// On the org where this was first investigated those four were 350k+ requests a
// day server-side and 0 browser sessions. So "bot share" here means "share of
// recorded sessions", never "share of traffic", and the UI must not imply the
// latter. Reaching the non-executing crawlers needs `http.user_agent` off
// Server spans, which is a different source and a different feature.
