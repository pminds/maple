// Browser analytics spans three coverage tiers:
// - navigation rows in `session_events` provide page views and URLs;
// - base `session_replays` columns provide device, country, and duration;
// - the optional analytics block provides visitor, acquisition, and language.
// `identifiedSessions` reports the third tier's coverage alongside totals.
//
// `session_replays` may expose both session versions before merging, so counts
// use `uniq[If](SessionId)`. Page views come from append-only navigation events.
// WHERE clauses use only columns written identically to both session versions.

 * `.neq("")` drops sessions that never populated the column (so a dimension
 * nobody sends renders as empty rather than as one giant blank row), and the
 * branch excludes its own filter so selecting a value leaves the alternatives
 * visible.
 *
 * The four acquisition dimensions are the exception to the first rule: there
 * the empty group *is* the answer — direct traffic for the referrer, an
 * untagged visit for UTM — and it is usually the largest bucket, so hiding it
 * made every share figure on the card a share of the wrong total. Those
 * branches emit it as `WEB_ANALYTICS_UNSET` so it can be selected as a filter.
 * (An empty referrer also covers internal navigation and `Referrer-Policy`
 * suppression; the UI still labels it "Direct", the way every analytics
 * product does.)
