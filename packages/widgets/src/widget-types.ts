// The widget type table.
//
// A dashboard widget has two persisted axes: `visualization` (which renderer and
// which data-source endpoint) and `display.chartId` (which `chartRegistry` entry
// a `chart` widget mounts). A **panel type** collapses them into one closed list
// — see `apps/web/src/lib/query-builder/panel-types.ts` for the history.
//
// This module is the single description of that list. It carries only what both
// runtimes can agree on: no React, no `@maple/ui`, no chart components. The web
// registry (`apps/web/src/components/dashboard-builder/widgets/widget-type-registry.tsx`)
// layers renderers, config panels and builder logic on top of these entries.
//
// Before this existed the same facts were forked across the web store, the
// portable-dashboard importer, the MCP tools and the Perses importer, and they
// had already drifted. Anything a new widget type needs to declare belongs here.
