/**
 * The legacy endpoint vocabulary — NOT schema.
 *
 * Before v3 a data source was `{ endpoint, params }`, and the endpoint string
 * carried the source's identity: `"custom_query_builder_timeseries"` meant "a
 * query set returning a timeseries", `"raw_sql_chart"` meant raw SQL. v3 makes
 * that identity structural (`kind` + `resultShape`), so the strings stop being
 * schema.
 *
 * They do not stop existing. Two contracts still speak them, and both outlive
 * the stored v2 resultKind:
 *
 * 1. The web app's server-function registry (`data-source-registry.ts`) is keyed
 *    by endpoint string, and that key is also the atom family key, the retention
 *    namespace, and the `LIST_ENDPOINTS` membership test.
 * 2. The public v2 HTTP API (`/v2/dashboards`) emits and accepts
 *    `{ endpoint, params }` and always will — a version number in a URL exists
 *    precisely so the internal resultKind can move without breaking published clients.
 *
 * They live in their own file, away from the schema modules, so that this
 * distinction survives contact with the next refactor: these are wire
 * vocabularies that happen to be strings, not a resultKind anything is stored in.
