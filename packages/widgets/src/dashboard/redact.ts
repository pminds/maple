/**
 * What a share link's holder is allowed to *see* of a dashboard.
 *
 * Distinct from what they are allowed to *run*. The server owning query
 * construction stops a viewer executing arbitrary queries; it does nothing
 * about the document itself, which is handed to the browser so the page can
 * lay out tiles and pick chart types. Shipped verbatim, that document would
 * publish the org's raw SQL, its where-clauses, its route params and the user
 * ids of whoever edited the board — to anyone holding a public link.
 *
 * So the share transport carries a projection, not the document. This module is
 * the single place that decides which fields survive.
 *
 * The rule is allowlist, never denylist: a field added to the stored schema
 * later is absent from the share until someone deliberately adds it here. A
 * denylist would leak every future field by default, which is exactly the wrong
 * direction for a payload served without a session.
