/**
 * The schema version a stored dashboard document is written in.
 *
 * This is NOT `dashboards.version` in Postgres — that column is the
 * compare-and-swap counter for optimistic concurrency, and it changes on every
 * write. This says what *shape* the JSON is in.
 *
 * A document with no `schemaVersion` key is version 1 by definition: the field
 * was introduced after those documents were written, so absence is the only
 * signal they can carry. `detectSchemaVersion` encodes that.
