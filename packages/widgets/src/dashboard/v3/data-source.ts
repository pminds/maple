 * string carried the source's identity and `params` carried its content, which
 * meant every reader had to know which endpoint names implied which param keys
 * — a contract enforced nowhere. v3 makes both structural: `kind` says what the
 * source *is*, and each arm declares the fields that arm actually has.
 *
 * The four arms are the four things a widget can be backed by, and they were
 * always these four — v2 just spelled them as string conventions.

 * discriminant narrowing that is this schema's entire point. Repeating one
 * optional field on four arms is the cheaper trade, and `ds.transform` still

 *    `packages/query-engine/src/query-set/dispatch.ts` consumes that flat shape
 *    *structurally* (it deliberately does not import `@maple/widgets`). Nesting
 *    would break that structural match silently, at runtime.
 * 2. A field added to `QuerySetSchema` — shared with alert rules — reaches
 *    widgets without an edit here.
 *
 * `resultShape` is required, where `dataSourceQuerySet` used to default it to
 * `"timeseries"` for a v2 source missing it. That default now lives in exactly
 * one place, the v2 -> v3 migration, which is where a default for legacy data
 * belongs.
