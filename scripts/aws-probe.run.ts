/**
 * Manual bisect harness for the ingest deploy hang (`.github/workflows/aws-probe.yml`).
 *
 * RESOLVED: the hang was alchemy's env-credential account lookup (an STS
 * GetCallerIdentity issued while AWSEnvironment is still being built) waiting
 * on its own half-built environment for the endpoint resolver — silent, no
 * network I/O. Setting AWS_ACCOUNT_ID skips the lookup; the workflows do.
 * Reproduced locally with `CI=true` and the id unset on beta.64 → beta.74.
 * The rest of this header is the original investigation, kept for the method.
 *
 * Four prd deploys wedged inside `alchemy deploy` with no output at any log
 * level, no AWS API call in CloudTrail, and no resource created. Every
 * candidate inside the process has been measured and cleared — module import
 * 1.2s, hashDirectory 39ms, the auth lock caps at 120s with an error, a local
 * plan reaches the generator in under a second. What was missing is a way to
 * ask the question in the environment where it actually happens without paying
 * a 45-minute production timeout per attempt.
 *
 * So: the same AWS provider set, on the same runner image, with the same OIDC
 * credentials, one resource class at a time.
 *
 * - `ecr`     — a repository. Does the AWS provider path work AT ALL in CI?
 * - `network` — a VPC. Does a multi-resource, slower graph work?
 * - `image`   — a docker build + ECR push of the real ingest context. This is
 *               the leading suspect: it runs before the first AWS call (which
 *               is why CloudTrail is empty) and alchemy logs nothing while it
 *               works, which is why the deploy looks dead.
 *
 * State is file-based, so this never touches the shared account state store,
 * and the CIDR is 10.99/16 — deliberately outside the 10.20/10.21 range
 * `resolveIngestCidrBlock` hands out, so a leaked probe VPC can never collide
 * with a real regional one.
