# Regenerate every raster app icon from the single source of truth,
# apps/landing/public/favicon.svg (ink tile + amber tree, the "Soot" colorway).
#
# Requires librsvg + imagemagick:  brew install librsvg imagemagick
#
# Only the tree outline is read out of the source; every tile below is built
# around it, so the artwork is defined in exactly one place.
#
# Two properties of the mark drive the whole file:
#
#   * It is ONE evenodd path. The eyes and the notch beside the trunk are
#     knockouts, so the tile reads through them — every variant must keep
#     fill-rule="evenodd" and a flat tile fill, or the eyes fill in solid.
#   * It is drawn in its own 739-unit box and bottom-cropped: the trunk runs
#     to the very bottom edge. Tiles therefore seat it on a baseline 2.5 units
#     up from the bottom rather than optically centring it, which would read
#     bottom-heavy. Round (maskable) targets centre it instead, because there
#     is no baseline to speak of once the corners are gone.
#
# Variants:
#   rounded    rx=7/32, mark at its drawn size. The 32px .ico frame — drawn
#              small but unmasked by browsers, so the tile carries its own
#              corner radius.
#   small      same tile, mark 1.15x larger and re-seated. Used for the 16px
#              .ico frame: at 16px the eyes are barely a pixel wide and
#              antialias into a single blob, so small frames get a tighter crop.
#   square     rx=0 and opaque. logo192/logo512 are the apple-touch-icon and
#              the schema.org Organization logo — iOS applies its own corner
#              mask, so transparent corners render as black notches, and
#              Google wants a solid mark.
#   bare       no tile, transparent. Android's adaptive foreground (the system
#              draws the background from app.json) and the Expo splash, which
#              composites over its own backgroundColor.
